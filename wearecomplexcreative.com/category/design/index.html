They will always put paid work over internal projects.\n\nSo, why are we different?!\n&lt;h2&gt;It\u2019s all about the environment&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThe main reason we are embarking on this website redesign journey is because we have been practising sustainable web design now for a couple of years.\n\nWe have been learning more and more about how to reduce the amount of carbon emitted from websites and produce sustainable websites.\n\nEach website project we\u2019ve done so far using sustainable web design practices has saved &lt;em&gt;over 150kg of carbon&lt;\/em&gt; per year!! This means, around 10 trees have been saved per year as a result of us rebuilding the website.\n\nThis is what we want to achieve with our website.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about making it low-carbon, lightweight and high performance, but we also want it to look amazing! Because it\u2019s easy to create a low-carbon website that\u2019s mainly text-based. But what about one with tons of custom graphics and animations?\n\nWe are all about practising what we preach!\n\nWhat\u2019s a better way to show that we are able to design and build you a bespoke WordPress website that\u2019s low carbon than to do it for ourselves?\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the effort to spend the best part of 2022 working on this website redesign project.\n&lt;h2&gt;Your website should always be about the user&lt;\/h2&gt;\nUser experience &lt;em&gt;should&lt;\/em&gt; be the number one concern when it comes to website design. However, most of the time, it\u2019s just one thing on a long list of requirements. The majority of companies only care about aesthetics and trying to think of ways to increase lead generation.\n\nBut if you concentrate on user experience, then it should take into account all the other \u201cfancy\u201d features, but with the customer in mind.\n\nWe have been speaking to our website users and they have told us that they mainly want more information about our services and easier access to our blogs. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning to do!\n&lt;h2&gt;Content is King&lt;\/h2&gt;\nYes, content is still king! To be fair, we don\u2019t think it will be knocked off its throne any time soon.\n\nWe spend a lot of time creating content to help our other small businesses and entrepreneurs with marketing help, website tips and design trends. Therefore, we want to make sure that our new website allows easy access to this content!\n\nAt the moment, the blog is hidden away and the articles are not that accessible, so we will be re-designing that with the user in mind too.\n\nWe are not quite ready to show the world yet, but the aim is to get the new site up just before Christmas!

Many just abandon the idea of trying to do [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/why-are-we-re-designing-our-own-website\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3757,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;6th September 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-09-06 07:00:19&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;As a creative agency, it\u2019s so natural for us to want to do great design work and take pride in the way that a website looks. However, we\u2019re also super passionate about sustainable web design and ensuring websites are built in a way that\u2019s good for the environment.\n\nThe problem is, fancy websites with lots of bells and whistles on it are often REALLY bad for the environment. So, how do you create nice-looking websites while making sure that your website is low-carbon.\n\nWe decided to explore some of the internal debates we\u2019ve been having while we design our new website, and those for clients, and the decisions we\u2019ve come to.\n&lt;h2&gt;Who &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;\/em&gt; watches videos?&lt;\/h2&gt;\nWe\u2019ve been talking about the power of video for years; they captivate the viewer and are able to deliver such a powerful message in just a few seconds.\n\nBecause of all the hype about video, people have stated putting video on their websites all over the place, just for the sake of it. But, how many people are actually watching your videos? You will see plenty of stats that show that videos are powerful, but lo and behold, these are often created by video marketing firms!\n\nYou can check your own website stats to be sure.\n\nOne of the biggest offenders in carbon emissions for websites is the use of video, so this is a great place to start. First of all, do you even need the video? And if so, please do NOT let them autoplay. This is also just &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.searchenginewatch.com/2017/05/19/how-video-impacts-mobile-web-performance-and-ux-part-2-autoplay-and-audio/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;hugely bad for UX&lt;\/a&gt; \u2013 it is so intrusive in someone\u2019s browsing experience.\n\nIf you do use video, can you host off your website? E.g. on YouTube? Then, put an image placeholder where the image is and a play button to send it to YouTube? That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing lately for clients and it\u2019s worked really well, as most users do not miss being able to watch the video when embedded.\n&lt;h2&gt;Do you need an image for each section?&lt;\/h2&gt;\nAnother bad habit by designers is to fill a website design with lots of images because it looks \u201cpretty\u201d. But are these images actually helpful to the user experience? If you\u2019re using stock images, then the answer is most likely a big, fat NO!\n\nImages can be extremely heavy and seriously affect the performance of a website if they\u2019re not uploaded in the correct size and format, so really think about the use of images where you can.\n\nIf possible, use lightweight illustrations in place of images. And if you don\u2019t have a relevant image, please don\u2019t use a stock image.\n&lt;h2&gt;Custom fonts&lt;\/h2&gt;\nMost companies have a pre-determined set of brand guidelines that are likely to include custom fonts, but the loading of these fonts use up resources.\n\nThe most efficient way to deal with this issue is to use &lt;a href=../../_https_/fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/system_font_web_safe_font/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;system fonts&lt;\/a&gt;, as these will already be installed on your server and will not require additional resources. However, designers will absolutely cringe at this suggestion and there are sure to be fights between your design and dev teams if this is suggested. The system fonts are not exactly too stylish.\n\nSo, the odds are that you\u2019re going to need to upload custom fonts. If you do, please make sure that you remove all the unnecessary font weights that you don\u2019t need and upload them in WOFF2 format.\n&lt;h2&gt;SEO pages&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThe marketing team are going to push you to create tons of landing pages that will help them with their SEO efforts. No doubt, having landing pages that have specific keywords and tailored content will be able to convert better, but creating hundreds of these just so that you can try to rank for these keywords may not also do well for your website performance.\n\nAnything that affects the performance of your website, is also going to affect the carbon emissions from your website.\n\nYou should be auditing your content on your website regularly to ensure that you have necessary content throughout your website.\n&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;\/h2&gt;\nYou can still create beautiful websites that are good for the environment; just be mindful of what the user actually requires, rather than trying to make the site look pretty for the sake of it.\n\nIt will be painful for design teams at first, but they learn to adapt to what\u2019s great for sustainable web design and the planet will thank us for it!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;The battle between good UI\/UX and Sustainable Web Design&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;battle-between-good-ui-ux-sustainable-web-design&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:45&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:45&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3757&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/balacing-ui-ux.jpeg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:29,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:29,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:29,&quot;category_count&quot;:10,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:32,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sustainability&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;sustainability&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:32,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:11,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:32,&quot;category_count&quot;:11,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Sustainability&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;sustainability&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s often a case of Cobbler\u2019s Shoes when it comes to a web design agency trying to design their own website. Many just abandon the idea of trying to do something fancy because they simply don\u2019t have the time.\n\n&lt;em&gt;Clients come first.&lt;\/em&gt;\n\nThat\u2019s what most agencies say\u2026 but what they really mean is &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;\/strong&gt; comes first. They will always put paid work over internal projects.\n\nSo, why are we different?!\n&lt;h2&gt;It\u2019s all about the environment&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThe main reason we are embarking on this website redesign journey is because we have been practising sustainable web design now for a couple of years.\n\nWe have been learning more and more about how to reduce the amount of carbon emitted from websites and produce sustainable websites.\n\nEach website project we\u2019ve done so far using sustainable web design practices has saved &lt;em&gt;over 150kg of carbon&lt;\/em&gt; per year!! This means, around 10 trees have been saved per year as a result of us rebuilding the website.\n\nThis is what we want to achieve with our website.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about making it low-carbon, lightweight and high performance, but we also want it to look amazing! Because it\u2019s easy to create a low-carbon website that\u2019s mainly text-based. But what about one with tons of custom graphics and animations?\n\nWe are all about practising what we preach!\n\nWhat\u2019s a better way to show that we are able to design and build you a bespoke WordPress website that\u2019s low carbon than to do it for ourselves?\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the effort to spend the best part of 2022 working on this website redesign project.\n&lt;h2&gt;Your website should always be about the user&lt;\/h2&gt;\nUser experience &lt;em&gt;should&lt;\/em&gt; be the number one concern when it comes to website design. However, most of the time, it\u2019s just one thing on a long list of requirements. The majority of companies only care about aesthetics and trying to think of ways to increase lead generation.\n\nBut if you concentrate on user experience, then it should take into account all the other \u201cfancy\u201d features, but with the customer in mind.\n\nWe have been speaking to our website users and they have told us that they mainly want more information about our services and easier access to our blogs. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning to do!\n&lt;h2&gt;Content is King&lt;\/h2&gt;\nYes, content is still king! To be fair, we don\u2019t think it will be knocked off its throne any time soon.\n\nWe spend a lot of time creating content to help our other small businesses and entrepreneurs with marketing help, website tips and design trends. Therefore, we want to make sure that our new website allows easy access to this content!\n\nAt the moment, the blog is hidden away and the articles are not that accessible, so we will be re-designing that with the user in mind too.\n\nWe are not quite ready to show the world yet, but the aim is to get the new site up just before Christmas! So, stay tuned for more information about the progress!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The battle between good UI\/UX and Sustainable Web Design&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;As a creative agency, it\u2019s so natural for us to want to do great design work and take pride in the way that a website looks.

This doesn\u2019t have to be a physical product, but it could be a service. Whatever you\u2019re selling, the purpose of your website is to showcase what you\u2019re selling and get as many people as possible to buy it!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone visiting your website is going to instantly make a purchase and they are going to be looking around the site for a while to influence their decision either way. So, you\u2019re going to want to optimise your ecommerce website so that it\u2019s designed to convert.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve put together this article to help you find ways of improving your conversion rate of your ecommerce website with these essential UX elements.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What is UX?&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nFirst of all, let\u2019s introduce what UX is exactly, because it\u2019s something that\u2019s misunderstood by many\u2026 including designers!\r\n\r\nUX stands for user experience and it\u2019s the process that design teams use to create meaningful and relevant experiences to users. It\u2019s essentially anything that affects the user\u2019s interaction with a product. And in this case, the \u201cproduct\u201d we\u2019re referring to is the ecommerce website.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like to delve further into what UX is and what UX design is, then we\u2019ve written an article particularly on that.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking to explore more just about ecommerce UX, then please read on for our essential UX elements for ecommerce websites!\r\n&lt;h2&gt;The User Journey on an Ecommerce Website&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nEssentially, the user journey of each person interacting with an e-commerce website goes through the same process. Your challenge is to make each step a wonderful experience for the user so that they keep progressing through the journey.\r\n\r\nThis user journey includes:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Website discovery&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Product search\/Browsing&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Product page&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Cart&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Checkout&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Confirmation&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nWe cover each of these stages and give you tips on how you can improve the UX at each step of this ecommerce user journey.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Stage 1: Website Discovery&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nMany people skip this part because they only concentrate on selling. But how do people find your website in the first place? And if they do, what should their first impression be?\r\n\r\nApparently &lt;a href=../../_https_/cxl.com/blog/first-impressions-matter-the-importance-of-great-visual-design/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;it takes just about 0.05 seconds&lt;\/a&gt; for people to form an opinion of a website! We\u2019re clearly very judgy people! But that\u2019s quite a scary statistic. Therefore, first impressions absolutely will count.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Great UI&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nUI stands for User Interface and refers to the overall look and feel of the design. Good UI should always take into account of the UX. Your ecommerce website should have great UI that\u2019s branded up accordingly to the company\u2019s brand identity and be simple and clear to navigate.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/lawsofux.com/en/hicks-law/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hick\u2019s Law&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; is a concept which states that the more options a person has, the longer they will take to choose. Now, if good UX states that you should make it as easy as possible for the user to find their information and make an informed decision, then you need to narrow down the number of choices for them.\r\n\r\nSo, great UI should include a minimalistic feel with clear call-to-action buttons, and landing pages dedicated to each major category\/product. &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/10-seo-tips-you-can-do-yourself/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;These are also fantastic for SEO.&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Homepage&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nSince your homepage is more than likely the first page a user will see, you need to make sure that it not only looks great, but easily shows the information they\u2019re looking for.\r\n\r\nA visible search bar, a couple of promotions and a visible value proposition at the front and centre is a great start. The below is an idea of how to lay out your homepage for your ecommerce website.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\&quot;attachment_3649\&quot; align=\&quot;alignnone\&quot; width=\&quot;460\&quot;]&lt;img class=\&quot;wp-image-3649 size-full\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/coredna-ux.png/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;460\&quot; height=\&quot;392\&quot; \/&gt; Source: coredna.com[\/caption]\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Easy Navigation&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nGreat ecommerce UX has fantastic navigation, that makes it super easy for users to find exactly what they want. They should be able to browse different product categories or filter out what they want.\r\n\r\nThese menus should be found in the header and the footer so that the user can access them at different stages of their journey.\r\n\r\nRemember Hick\u2019s Law though!\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Product Search&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Add a search bar&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nSearch bars are one of the most important components for any e-commerce website. When a user lands on your site, they typically have a specific item or service in mind and will use the search bar to find what they're looking for. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.invespcro.com/blog/impulse-buying/_According.html to research done by Invesp&lt;\/a&gt;, 60% of users shop online with intent \u2013 they\u2019re not impulsive buyers.\r\n\r\nThe size of your search bar should be small enough that users don't get overwhelmed with results yet large enough so that they can easily read what's being searched for without having to squint at tiny text (or worse: misspellings). We think it\u2019s best to include a long bar next to a magnifying glass, to make it clear what it\u2019s for.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget about the search results though! We\u2019ve seen many developers add a search bar and then forget to customise the results pages and they\u2019re a mess! Ensure that the results pages display the results clearly.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Filters&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nFilters are another way of improving the UX of product search, especially if you have a site with several products. You can include the usual filters such as colour and size etc., but if you really delve deep into who your target audience is, you can provide some much more personalised filter options.\r\n\r\nAdding a price filter is usually very popular, so people can immediately find products that they can afford, rather than being disappointed when they see the price.\r\n\r\nWe love &lt;a href=../../_http_/asos.com/_ASOS/u2019/a.html filter system:\r\n\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3650\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/asos-filter.png/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;990\&quot; height=\&quot;534\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Product Page&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Use beautiful product photos (and video!)&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nProduct photos tell a story and create an emotional connection with the product. The best way to do this is to have multiple photos of the item from all angles, so that customers can see exactly what they're getting. Definitely get a professional photographer to shoot your products, no matter how good you think you are at doing it! Because there\u2019s a huge difference between the output and in turn, a big difference in sales.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/16-visual-content-marketing-statistics-that-will-wake-you-up-59c4c0b80465/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Larry Kim, an infamous digital marketer, blogged&lt;\/a&gt; that video actually makes users 85% more likely to purchase a product! So, if you can get videos of your products or video testimonials, then this is a great idea. People connect to videos as they feel more \u201creal\u201d and get a better vibe and build more trust.\r\n\r\nHowever, just ensure that you don\u2019t put too much content on your page or upload these photos\/videos without optimising them properly or you will end up with a slow website and that\u2019s definitely not good for UX!\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Include detailed product descriptions.&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nWhile the product image is essential, it's not enough to simply show your product. You need to provide the full story behind what you're selling, including details about its features and benefits.\r\n\r\nA great way to do this is by providing a detailed description of the item you're selling. This could include:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;A description of what the product is (e.g., \&quot;This is a red medium t-shirt with black sleeves\&quot;).&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;A list of all relevant features (e.g., \&quot;The shirt has four pockets on each side\&quot;).&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;A list of all relevant benefits for customers when buying this item (e.g., \&quot;Sleek pockets allow you to store things in them\&quot;).&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Include shipping information and returns process&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nYour ecommerce website footer should show this information, but it\u2019s worth putting on the individual product pages too. The more transparent you are about your processes, the more confident people will be about making a purchase.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Add Trust Indicators&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nAdding to the above about being transparent about everything on your site, you build trust in your brand. You can also do this by adding in ratings, reviews and other social proof.\r\n\r\nTestimonials from happy customers can be a great way to add credibility to your website. If you have clients who are willing to share their experiences with your business, simply ask them for permission to use their testimonials on your site. You can even include a form where people can submit their own testimonials if they don't want their full name published on the site.\r\n\r\nYou can try plugging in a widget from other well-known review platforms such as Trustpilot. Their reputation alone will add validity to your brand if you are showing the reviews directly from their site.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/learn.g2.com/customer-reviews-statistics/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;More than 70% of users&lt;\/a&gt; won\u2019t make a purchase until they\u2019ve read a review, and people are heavily influenced by others. There are lots of &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-social-proof-wordpress-plugins-easy-to-use/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;social proof plugins&lt;\/a&gt; that you can use on a WooCommerce site and they often pop up with confirmation that someone just purchased a product in real time.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Checkout&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Have a clear order summary&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nAnother very helpful stage is the order summary page, as this allows the user to easily review everything they\u2019ve purchased, how much it costs and if they want to make any changes.\r\n\r\nAgain, this means that there are no surprises at checkout.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Provide multiple payment options and make checkout easy&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nThe last thing you want to do is to put your customer off purchasing right at the last stage, so keep the checkout simple and clear. No offers popping up or distractions on the page.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of payment options available to e-commerce websites, including:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.)&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;PayPal&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Apple Pay&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Google Wallet&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nIt\u2019s important to understand what type of payment your target audience prefers to use as it\u2019s all about improving their user journey. However, having multiple checkout options is a often a good idea so that users can select the one they prefer and check out swiftly.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Let users checkout as a guest&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.veeqo.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-ux/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Veeqo list the lack of a guest checkout&lt;\/a&gt; as their number one reason for lack of UX conversions. Customers do not necessarily want to be forced to join another mailing list and have yet another account at an ecommerce website, and so there should definitely be a guest checkout option.\r\n\r\nAgain, this removes the friction of being forced to put in all their extra details to be able to complete the purchase.\r\n\r\nHowever, a nice thing to do is to add a checkbox so they can easily create an account after purchasing so that they don\u2019t have to fill in all their information again if they do want to revisit the site.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Order Confirmation&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nJust like with an order summary, it\u2019s important that you include a clear order confirmation screen with all the details on it, so that users can quickly check they didn\u2019t miss anything out or make a mistake. This allows for quick action should they need to amend anything.\r\n\r\nOnce an order is made, a lot goes on behind the scenes to get it ready; for example, you may have the order connected to a warehouse, who finds the product, arranges shipping with a courier etc., and so it\u2019s often too late to cancel or amend the order after this process has started.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Email Updates&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nGood UX includes the post-sale communication. Keep your buyer up to date with the status of their order by explaining where it\u2019s at in the shipping journey. Provide them with tracking updates and other actions they can take in the meantime, along with contact information should they wish to change anything.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Additional Ecommerce UX Elements&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nWe arranged the above UX tips for an ecommerce website in categories based on the stage of the user journey, but we thought we\u2019d include a few more tips that are more generalised.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;UX (user experience) on mobile phones&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nAccording to &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/mobile-commerce-shopping-trends-stats/_Business.html Insider\u2019s Intelligence report on mobile ecommerce shopping trends of 2022,&lt;\/a&gt; over 40% of all ecommerce revenue comes from mobile phones. This may be considerably more for your website and you will need to check your data in Google Analytics to compare.\r\n\r\nBut it definitely means that your website should be mobile-friendly. This also doesn\u2019t mean just having a responsive website design, but mobile UX should have specifically been taken into account and more than likely a specific separate mobile design have been undertaken to maximise the user journey on a mobile.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;FAQ page&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nAn FAQ page is a great way to just answer your customers\u2019 most common questions. Not only does it help increase the chances of a sale because their questions will have been answered for them right there on the site, but it also saves you customer service time! You may have had to answer an email, live chat message or a phone call to answer this customer\u2019s question.\r\n\r\nDisplay your FAQ page on the footer of your ecommerce website so it\u2019s available on each page, but also on the relevant product pages.\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Contact page&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\nIt\u2019s super frustrating for a user if they cannot get in touch with an ecommerce company. It also makes the company look a bit shady if there are not many contact options. With so many scams out there at the moment, companies need to do what they can to show they\u2019re a legitimate business.\r\n\r\nSo, have a contact page with multiple ways to get in touch, including links to social media channels.

However, most of the time, it\u2019s just one thing on a long list of requirements. The majority of companies only care about aesthetics and trying to think of ways to increase lead generation.\n\nBut if you concentrate on user experience, then it should take into account all the other \u201cfancy\u201d features, but with the customer in mind.\n\nWe have been speaking to our website users and they have told us that they mainly want more information about our services and easier access to our blogs.

This doesn\u2019t have to be a physical product, but it could be a service. Whatever you\u2019re selling, the [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/essential-ux-elements-for-a-sucessful-ecommerce-website\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3336,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;17th May 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-05-17 13:03:18&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;If you\u2019ve ever done a website project before, then you will probably be well aware of the many things that can go wrong\u2026 from both sides! But the way to avoid these issues is with a detailed website design brief.\r\n\r\nA well-written website design brief details all the requirements for the project so that the agency\/freelancer knows exactly what to expect. This means that there will be fewer chances for scope creep from the client and the agency has clear instructions on what they\u2019re expected to deliver.\r\n\r\nMost companies don\u2019t bother with a website brief as they feel that a few calls with the agency should be enough to explain their \u201cvision\u201d. But a detailed brief can also help the client as they really need to know what they want to be able to put it all down in a brief.\r\n\r\nThis usually helps them rethink about their company\u2019s goals, who they\u2019re trying to attract with the website and exactly what features are required.\r\n\r\nWe believe that a good website brief is beneficial to everyone involved, so we\u2019ve put together a short guide on what information should be in a good website design brief.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can go wrong with a website design project?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nWe thought we\u2019d start by highlighting some of the things that often go wrong during a website design project so you can understand further where the brief can help:\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;Communication issues&lt;\/strong&gt;: this is always the number one problem that causes problems in any business relationship. There are a number of different possible communication issues, but we will focus on clients not explaining all their requirements properly and missing out key bits of information and agencies not communicating when they hit boundaries, and this causes delays to the project. Both of these issues can be fixed with a detailed brief.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;Scope creep&lt;\/strong&gt;: let\u2019s face it, all clients try to sneak in extra bits to get their \u201cvalue for money\u201d and most agencies are happy to oblige some small things to ensure they have a happy customer. But there needs to be a detailed Scope of Work so that agencies can draw the line when clients start to take advantage.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;Additional budget required&lt;\/strong&gt;: no one likes surprise bills and many agencies are known to add extra costs to things because they claimed to have \u201cnot known\u201d about certain requirements. If everything is detailed in the brief, there should be no reason for this.\r\n\r\nThere are obviously plenty of things that can go wrong with any project, but we want to focus on how a good website design brief can solve some of the common issued faced between clients and web design agencies.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you put in your web design brief?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3339\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/create-a-good-web-design-brief.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;1520\&quot; height=\&quot;1013\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n\r\nA good web design brief should provide a good overview of the client\u2019s business and the project overview. It should identify the key deliverables and requirements as well as the ideal web design process they expect to see. Specifics such as monetary expenses and timelines should also be included.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;Project overview&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this website? Who do you want to attract? Why are you choosing to undergo this website project now? The more defined your objective, the easier it will be to create a design that accomplishes that goal.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;Who do you want to attract?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe first thing to figure out is who you want to attract and why. What are the demographics of your target audience? What do they like, dislike, and have in common? This will help determine what kind of content you should create for them and what the user journey will be like. If you have a current website, you can obtain accurate data from Google Analytics to understand who your ideal target audience is.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;- Do you have any preferences?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nHave you seen any websites that you like? They don\u2019t have to be competitor sites, but any sites you admire and would like yours to be done in the same sort of way. Dislikes are also very useful too!\r\n\r\nDo you have a set of brand guidelines that you need us to follow? Or particular elements that must be used\/not used on the site?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;- Who are your competitors?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nKnowing your competitors is an important part of the process. You need to be aware of what they are doing and offering, as well as their pricing structure.\r\n\r\nIf you are in a service-based business, it's also good to know what your competitors aren't doing or offering\u2014it may open up opportunities for you in the future.\r\n\r\nWe definitely don\u2019t recommend using a competitor\u2019s site as a base and trying to copy it, as that\u2019s how you dampen creativity and you won\u2019t be able to embrace your own brand. Use them to analyse a gap in the market and where you should be targeting.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;What is your brand voice? How do you want to be perceived?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3340\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/brand-voice.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;1520\&quot; height=\&quot;1140\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n\r\nWhile you\u2019re working on the content and design of your website, it\u2019s also important to consider how your brand should be represented visually. This includes developing a tone that reflects the personality of your business, as well as how you want to be remembered by customers.\r\n\r\nWhat is the tone of your brand? How do you want to be perceived? What is the personality of your brand? These questions are all part of defining what we call \u201cbrand voice.\u201d These questions should have already been answered in your brand guidelines, but if not, it\u2019s important to address them now.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;What are the project requirements?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis section should go into a lot of detail as this is the part that affects the quote significantly.\r\n\r\nYou will need to consider the following questions about your project:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;What are the project requirements?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;What is the technology that you want to use?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Will it require any e-commerce functionality or other complicated functions?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Will you require any 3rd party integrations?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Do you also require website hosting?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;How much content will the website require?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;Who are the decision makers?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIt is also important to know who is going to be the main point of contact for your project. This can often be the same person as the decision maker, but not always. The main aim here is to make sure that you have someone who can answer any questions and deal with any issues that arise during your project.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth knowing who will be responsible for both managing the budget and setting deadlines. If these are different people, it\u2019s important that they work together closely so there aren\u2019t any differences in approach or expectation between them.\r\n\r\nWe believe that decision-makers should be introduced to agencies as early on in the process as possible so that they can assess the chemistry and see if they\u2019re a good fit without wasting people\u2019s time.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;How much do you want to spend?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nHere, you need to be honest with yourself. You won\u2019t get what you don\u2019t ask for, after all. How much do you want to spend? A website is a valuable and worthwhile investment, but it\u2019s not necessarily worth tens of thousands of pounds and months of time to many people.\r\n\r\nIf your project has specific goals, like an increase in sales or traffic, or if your client needs an online presence for their business that doesn't exist yet, then these goals will determine how much the site will cost and how long it will take to build.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to be honest about your budget and also realistic. If you\u2019re serious about your website design project, then you need to set a decent budget aside so that it\u2019s done properly. Also bear in mind costs such as hosting and maintenance, plugins, videography\/photography etc., that may be an additional cost.\r\n\r\n- &lt;strong&gt;When do you need the website done by?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nYou now know what you want from your website, but there are still a few important questions to answer.\r\n\r\nFirst, how long will it take to get the project done? There\u2019s no point in starting if you don\u2019t know when it will be finished. Second, how long will it take for approval? If you have an internal committee that needs to sign off on everything before moving forward with any new ideas or designs (and who doesn't?), then make sure they have ample time to review and approve your website proposal before going ahead with any design work. Thirdly, when will your new site go live?\r\n\r\nAnd finally: after launch date is set and everything goes smoothly during development and testing phases (which they should), how long until your website actually goes live?\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThe website brief is the foundation for your web design project. It\u2019s the first step in creating a successful website, so it should be comprehensive and clear. As we saw in this post, there are many things to consider when putting together an effective website brief. But don\u2019t worry\u2014if you follow these tips, you\u2019ll be able to create one that will serve as an invaluable guide for your web design agency throughout the entire project!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;How to create the perfect website design brief&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;how-to-create-the-perfect-website-design-brief&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2022-10-14 17:24:52&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-10-14 16:24:52&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3336&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Website-Brief.jpeg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:29,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:29,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:29,&quot;category_count&quot;:10,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s often a case of Cobbler\u2019s Shoes when it comes to a web design agency trying to design their own website.

These are clients who ask for UI\/UX work because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve heard they need, but they don\u2019t quite understand what it is. Then, there are graphic designers who write to us asking for a job and they claim to be a UX designer, but in fact, they are not.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we thought it would be good to clear up what UX is and how we use it in our business.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What is UX (User Experience)?&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThe term UX was &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;founded by Don Norman&lt;\/a&gt;, the co-founder of the Nielson Normal Group. Here\u2019s how he originally defined it:\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;\u201cUser experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user\u2019s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.\u201d&lt;\/em&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen someone uses a product, they are often thinking about these 4 aspects:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value: &lt;\/strong&gt;do I get value when I\u2019m using this product?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function: &lt;\/strong&gt;does this product work as it should?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability: &lt;\/strong&gt;is it easy to use?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall impression: &lt;\/strong&gt;how does it make me feel when I use it?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Essentials of UX&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nUser experience is not just about what people &lt;em&gt;think&lt;\/em&gt; but it\u2019s largely about &lt;em&gt;feelings. &lt;\/em&gt;Humans act very emotionally when it comes to purchase decisions and their connections to products and services. So, we need to consider how the user experience makes people feel during their interactions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a user\u2019s experience is likely to change over time. When using a new product or service, most users will have a mixed set of feelings. However, as they become more familiar and have more experience, their minds can change\u2026 for better or for worse!\r\n&lt;h2&gt;So, what is UX design?&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3696\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/ux-design.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;1280\&quot; height=\&quot;961\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n\r\nSince you cannot actually design a user\u2019s experience, UX design is quite an interesting term. Essentially, UX designers are ones who design to create a great user experience. Therefore, they create products (both digital products like websites and physical one) that are functional, usable and creates pleasure.\r\n\r\nWe absolutely love &lt;a href=../../_http_/semanticstudios.com/user_experience_design/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Semantic Studios\u2019 UX Honeycomb&lt;\/a&gt; to explain this! Here are their 7 categories of UX design:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Useful: &lt;\/strong&gt;A product should fulfil a need, otherwise there\u2019s no point for it to exist.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Usable: &lt;\/strong&gt;A product should be easy to use.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Desirable: &lt;\/strong&gt;The aesthetics of the product should be attractive, but also contain elements of emotional design.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Findable:&lt;\/strong&gt; Users should be able to find a solution to any issues they have with the product\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Accessible:&lt;\/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;web standards for digital&lt;\/a&gt; products which we need to follow to ensure those with disabilities can also enjoy the products.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Credible:&lt;\/strong&gt; The company needs to be trustworthy and understand what users get influenced by.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Valuable:&lt;\/strong&gt; The design must match the company\u2019s mission and help with the bottom line, including customer satisfaction.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What\u2019s the difference between UX and UI?&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThe terms UI\/UX often go hand-in-hand, as you need both to create a truly beautiful product. Naturally, UI is a big part of UX, but they are different.\r\n\r\nUI stands for User Interface and relates to the visual design of the various elements of the product. For example, the typography, animations, colour palette, CTAs etc.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important that UI designers understand good UX too.&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;What is UX?&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;what-is-ux&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2022-10-14 18:18:00&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-10-14 17:18:00&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3694&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/what-is-ux.jpg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:29,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:29,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:29,&quot;category_count&quot;:10,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s often a case of Cobbler\u2019s Shoes when it comes to a web design agency trying to design their own website. Many just abandon the idea of trying to do something fancy because they simply don\u2019t have the time.\n\n&lt;em&gt;Clients come first.&lt;\/em&gt;\n\nThat\u2019s what most agencies say\u2026 but what they really mean is &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;\/strong&gt; comes first. They will always put paid work over internal projects.\n\nSo, why are we different?!\n&lt;h2&gt;It\u2019s all about the environment&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThe main reason we are embarking on this website redesign journey is because we have been practising sustainable web design now for a couple of years.\n\nWe have been learning more and more about how to reduce the amount of carbon emitted from websites and produce sustainable websites.\n\nEach website project we\u2019ve done so far using sustainable web design practices has saved &lt;em&gt;over 150kg of carbon&lt;\/em&gt; per year!! This means, around 10 trees have been saved per year as a result of us rebuilding the website.\n\nThis is what we want to achieve with our website.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about making it low-carbon, lightweight and high performance, but we also want it to look amazing! Because it\u2019s easy to create a low-carbon website that\u2019s mainly text-based. But what about one with tons of custom graphics and animations?\n\nWe are all about practising what we preach!\n\nWhat\u2019s a better way to show that we are able to design and build you a bespoke WordPress website that\u2019s low carbon than to do it for ourselves?\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the effort to spend the best part of 2022 working on this website redesign project.\n&lt;h2&gt;Your website should always be about the user&lt;\/h2&gt;\nUser experience &lt;em&gt;should&lt;\/em&gt; be the number one concern when it comes to website design. However, most of the time, it\u2019s just one thing on a long list of requirements. The majority of companies only care about aesthetics and trying to think of ways to increase lead generation.\n\nBut if you concentrate on user experience, then it should take into account all the other \u201cfancy\u201d features, but with the customer in mind.\n\nWe have been speaking to our website users and they have told us that they mainly want more information about our services and easier access to our blogs. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning to do!\n&lt;h2&gt;Content is King&lt;\/h2&gt;\nYes, content is still king! To be fair, we don\u2019t think it will be knocked off its throne any time soon.\n\nWe spend a lot of time creating content to help our other small businesses and entrepreneurs with marketing help, website tips and design trends. Therefore, we want to make sure that our new website allows easy access to this content!\n\nAt the moment, the blog is hidden away and the articles are not that accessible, so we will be re-designing that with the user in mind too.\n\nWe are not quite ready to show the world yet, but the aim is to get the new site up just before Christmas! So, stay tuned for more information about the progress!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;What is UX?&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;The reason we\u2019ve chosen to speak about this topic is because we speak to many people who are confused about what UX is. These are clients who ask for UI\/UX [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/what-is-ux\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3327,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;22nd February 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-02-22 12:19:57&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;When a small business has a creative project that needs external help, they often wonder what the best route is \u2013 a creative agency or a freelancer? While there are pros and cons to both sides, we believe that it ultimately comes down to what works best for your business.\r\n\r\nNaturally, we\u2019re an agency writing this article, so you may think there will be a bias towards picking an agency\u2026 but remember \u2013 we\u2019re the Public Relation  Agency, so it will be a bit disingenuous if we were to sway you in a direction that we didn\u2019t think were true. We\u2019ve turned down many clients in the past as we didn\u2019t think they were ready for an agency.\r\n\r\nSo, here are our thoughts on whether you should pick a freelancer or an agency:\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nReliability is one of the biggest considerations when it comes to picking a creative partner. You want someone who handles the scope of work on time and on budget. Regular communication is also required so that you can plan your own marketing activity around the project and not cause delays to your business.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re paying by the hour, you need to be able to trust that the person will only bill for the time done and not just add hours to get a bigger bill. It\u2019s also more than just about delivering work: if there are any problems along the way, can they be solved quickly? Will they return calls\/emails\/messages promptly? If something goes wrong with an order, will they take responsibility and fix it without making excuses or blaming others?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Agency&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nGenerally, an agency will be much more reliable because they have a team behind them. If a freelancer gets sick, your project is on hold until they get better. They are also likely to accept work whenever it comes in, meaning they are often overstretched and cannot deliver the work on time. Surprisingly, they are usually the ones to bill for unexpected charges as they can often get away with it. Agencies are often worried about their reputation, but freelancers go under the radar.\r\n\r\nThere are also plenty of agencies who are unreliable and terrible with communication. But with multiple people who can work on your project at one time, they should be the better bet. Ideally, pick an agency with dedicated account manager so you always have someone who can update you on your project status, but also have a direct line to the individuals working on your project.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience and expertise&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;size-full wp-image-3353 aligncenter\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/freelancer.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;1273\&quot; height=\&quot;1500\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n\r\nThis one is a tricky one as you will get a range in both options! With a freelancer, they could be someone who can\u2019t get a job and so they decided to go it alone. This would possibly mean their work is not as good as the industry average. However, an experienced freelancer will have picked up a huge amount of expertise and experience over their years and can produce quality work that could be better than many agencies.\r\n\r\nWithin most agencies, there will be someone who is extremely experienced and talented, but they may not be the one who actually works on our account. Agencies are known to send their best people into pitch, but depending on the size of your project, they could actually put their most junior person on it. So, you actually get a poor finished product despite being wowed by their impressive salesperson.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Freelancer&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWe would say that in general, an agency would beat a freelancer here, but if you\u2019re &lt;em&gt;only&lt;\/em&gt; looking at experienced freelancers v agencies, then the freelancer wins because you will guarantee to get the experienced person working on your project.\r\n\r\nGranted, be careful because freelancers also outsource their work when they\u2019re busy!\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency\/Quality&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nIn theory, both a freelancer and an agency should be consistent with the quality that they put out. The problem is, they\u2019re not!\r\n\r\nFreelancers should in theory be more consistent because it\u2019s always them doing the work. However, their schedules are often a lot more erratic and they are known to put in ridiculous hours to cover the immense workload that they\u2019ve taken on. So, their quality slips as a result. They rush projects just to get something back before a deadline, don\u2019t check back their work and are juggling so many projects that they make mistakes all over the place.\r\n\r\nAgencies have a variety of people working in the team so it likely you will get a variety in the outputs you receive due to different people working on your project. However, since there is always someone senior and more experienced in each creative agency, you will always get your worked passed through a senior creative\u2019s eye, meaning that you will get top quality.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Agency&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWith most agencies also having a project manager overlooking the process, there will be fewer mistakes as it\u2019s been reviewed by an additional pair of eyes before being submitted for review. This gives agencies a huge advantage over freelancers who are too close to their project to notice some of these errors.\r\n\r\nThe diversity in an agency can also bring much more to the creative process compared to just one person.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThis situation may have changed over the last couple of years as freelancers in some sectors now charge more than agencies do! For example, freelance website developers are incredibly expensive as they know they\u2019re in demand. They also charge day rates or per hour and so your bill could be endless.\r\n\r\nHowever, agencies still have much larger overheads than freelancers and so will need to charge accordingly to cover these.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Freelancer&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIn general, freelancers will be a lot cheaper than agencies. So, if you have a strict budget and you just want to find the cheapest option, then a freelancer is most likely the right choice. However, this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the best value for money\u2026 (see value section below).\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;size-full wp-image-3354 aligncenter\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/agency.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;1500\&quot; height=\&quot;1000\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n\r\nEvery project always ends up requiring more than anticipated. For example, if you\u2019re getting your website designed and built and you think you only need the design and development resources, you will often realise that you need marketing input and probably animation too.\r\n\r\nMost freelancers are limited in their skills and specialise in one or two things. Already finding a freelancer to do &lt;em&gt;both&lt;\/em&gt; the design and build well is tricky! You will likely need one website designer and one website developer to complete the job. However, in the middle of the project, if you need unexpected resources, it\u2019s going to be tricky if you\u2019re using a freelancer.\r\n\r\nIn an agency, you will usually have people with a wide range of skills that you can tap into should you need it.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Agency&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nFull-service creative agencies are useful for this exact reason \u2013 you don\u2019t need to keep going to several places to finish one project. One creative agency can do everything consistently.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turnaround Time&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThis is a tricky one, as both freelancers and agencies have their pros and cons here. We\u2019d say that a freelancer generally is slower because there\u2019s only one of them! So, if they\u2019re doing everything themselves, they\u2019d need time to get the project done.\r\n\r\nHowever, agencies have multiple people who can work on different parts of the project at the same time, drastically improving the turnaround time. The problem is, many large agencies have very complicated processes that involve several people and there\u2019s a lot of red tape involved before you even can get a meeting with someone!\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Agency&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve picked an agency here, but only if you go with a &lt;em&gt;small &lt;\/em&gt;agency. The larger agencies are notoriously slow with projects and they generally only take on huge projects that take months to create. So, if you have a small project, you\u2019d also be of low priority to them.\r\n\r\nSmaller agencies are much more agile and they can utilise the different members of their team to get your project done much more quickly than a larger agency as they don\u2019t have complicated processes with too many people involved.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nAt the end of the day, this is all you care about for your business \u2013 to ensure you see value in your investment. However, the problem is, value is subjective. What does value mean to your business? Does it mean you have the most dramatic and fancy website compared to any of your competitors regardless of cost? Does it mean that you can brag your website was designed by an award-winning agency? Does it mean you got your business online for very cheap? Does it mean you learned a lot along the way due to the expertise and education the agency\/freelancer gave you? Or does it mean you\u2019ve found a life-long partner for your business because you\u2019ve finally found a creative solution for your various creative and marketing needs?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Both&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWe cannot pick a winner here because it really depends on what value means to you and where you see the benefits in the relationship.\r\n\r\nEither way, you will find pros and cons for using a freelancer or an agency.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThe bottom line is that both freelancers and agencies can offer you the same high-quality work. The main difference is their approach to projects and their availability. It's up to you as an entrepreneur or business owner to decide which type of web design company fits your needs best so that you get the most bang for your buck!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;Freelancer v Agency: Which one should you choose?&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;freelancer-v-agency-which-one-should-you-choose&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:03:40&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:03:40&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3327&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Freelancer-v-Agency.jpeg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:49,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Branding&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;branding&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:49,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:3,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:49,&quot;category_count&quot;:3,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Branding&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;branding&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:29,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:29,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:29,&quot;category_count&quot;:10,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:26,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:26,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:24,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:26,&quot;category_count&quot;:24,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s often a case of Cobbler\u2019s Shoes when it comes to a web design agency trying to design their own website.
