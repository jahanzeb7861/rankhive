Even more websites are powered by WordPress now \u2013 &lt;a href=../../_https_/blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-stats/_43.html of the internet, compared to 39.5% of the internet in 2021&lt;\/a&gt;!\n\nThis means that more users are creating WordPress websites, but this unfortunately means more mistakes are being made.\n\nThe majority of people making WordPress websites are not experts. The CMS is designed for those who don\u2019t have coding knowledge and so this isn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s worrying is that there are several WordPress agencies in London also making these basic mistakes! Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know who is truly a WordPress expert out there, even if they say they\u2019re a \u201ctop WordPress agency\u201d.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the biggest mistakes made in WordPress?&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we are dealing with hundreds of different WordPress websites every year, we thought we would put together an article to go through the top 15 mistakes that we\u2019ve seen with WordPress sites this year.\n\nSome of these WordPress mistakes have caused companies to lose their entire website, drop off the face of Google, lose thousands of pounds of revenue and one even lost their investment.\n\nSo, these errors can be detrimental, but yet many are very easy to fix.\n\nThere are in no particular order of severity, as you should really be doing them all :)\n&lt;div style=\&quot;border: 1px solid #fff; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px;\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\&quot;font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 2rem;\&quot;&gt;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022:&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;margin: 0; list-style-type: auto; list-style-position: inside;\&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#no-backups\&quot;&gt;No backups&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;Blocking indexing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe cannot believe we still see this one, as this has been an absolute \u201cno no\u201d with WordPress for decades now!\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve taken over several websites built by other agencies who has \u201cadmin\u201d as the username and we\u2019ve seen many developers who submit their trial task to us during the recruitment process do this rookie error too.\n\nSo, why is it so bad?\n\nWhen hackers try to get into a WordPress site, it\u2019s the first name they guess! Then, they use brute force attacks to try and guess your password. It might not sound likely that they\u2019ll get in, but bots are so powerful these days and they can guess millions of passwords per minute!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;no-backups\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No backups&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nIt should be a no-brainer to back up your website, just like with anything else. But yet people still don\u2019t do it. These are the same people who probably never back up their files on their computer, save documents while they\u2019re working on it or take out insurance.\n\nThey never think it will happen to them, but cry and curse when it does!\n\nBack in the day, backups were fairly expensive. Companies used to rip you off as they know how important they are. But now, all good hosting companies should offer free backup solutions. And they should be daily too.\n\nIf you are a company who regularly updates your website, the last thing you want to do is end up re-doing all those changes if something goes wrong.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve had to repair the styling of multiple WordPress websites because there is no child theme\u2026 AND\u2026 no backup!! Crazy crazy crazy!\n\nNot sure what a child theme even is? Then, you probably don\u2019t have one, unless your site was built by a professional.\n\nA child theme is a copy of the \u201cparent\u201d theme, which is the main theme you installed when building your WordPress website. The child theme will have all of the same features, functionalities and styles as the parent theme when you create it.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that when you update the theme, you override all the files in the theme folder, but the ones in the child theme remain.\n\nTherefore, whenever you make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;\/em&gt; changes to the theme, which includes all your styling \u2013 colours, fonts etc. then all this will disappear when you update the website.\n\nWe often hear people scared of updating their website because it \u201cbreaks\u201d the site, but this is usually the reason why!\n\nThere are some additional reasons why websites can break after updates, which we will cover a bit later.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is definitely the most common mistake we see in WordPress websites. In fact, we think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;\/em&gt; website that has ever come to us uses too many plugins!!\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to install a bunch of plugins to get lots of cool functionality on your website, but this just causes a whole host of problems.\n\nEach plugin massively slows down your website, causing performance problems, and increasing the carbon output. This is not good if you want to have a sustainable website.\n\nIt also comes with security issues \u2013 hackers find vulnerabilities in plugins, exploit them, and then destroy your website. This is why it\u2019s also essential to update your WordPress website regularly! More on that later!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nPlugins are dangerous territory if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! We already know that problems occur when you add too many plugins to your website, but there are also \u201cbad\u201d plugins to install too.\n\nWith a &lt;a href=../../_https_/kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/_database.html of 55,000+ plugins&lt;\/a&gt;, (and the rest from other sources), it\u2019s difficult to know which ones you shouldn\u2019t install.\n\nFirst of all, you should only be installing plugins when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5659\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Plugins-1-800x423.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;423\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nSecondly, there are signs to look out for when you\u2019re installing a plugin: When was the last time it was updated? How many downloads has it had? What are the reviews like?\n\nIf you have a plugin with thousands of downloads from happy customers and you can see it\u2019s recently been updated, you\u2019re less likely to run into any problems. If a plugin has decent reviews but hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, it can still pose security risks considering technology progresses very quickly.\n\nPlus, many plugins cause conflicts with each other. If you install a particular plugin, it could end up stopping another plugin from running, so you need to ensure that you test out the plugins on a &lt;strong&gt;test server&lt;\/strong&gt; first.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis one is going to surprise (and annoy) a lot of you.\n\nPage builders are bad.\n\nThere, we said it.\n\nYes, they help people edit their own sites nice and easily, but they\u2019re also terrible for performance. Each page builder adds functionality to the website using really bloated code and often introduce HTML errors that are impossible to fix.\n\nIt also goes against sustainable web design practice and your website will be a lot less green because of it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWhile we\u2019re talking about green websites and performance, let\u2019s talk about the number one culprit for slow websites \u2013 large images.\n\nEven if you were to run your own website through &lt;a href=../../_http_/pagespeed.web.dev/_Google/u2019s.html PageSpeeds&lt;\/a&gt;, the top result is likely to come back with \u201ccompress your images\u201d.\n\nThe problem is, if you want your website to look nice, then you want nice images on it. We get it. These nice images usually have huge files sizes too!\n\nBut you can size them down and compress them without losing quality before uploading them to your website.\n\nMost people don\u2019t do this.\n\nSome people are somewhere in the middle and use a plugin to compress their images for them. This is lazy and simply not good enough!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nDo you know how many websites we see that still have dummy data on their website? We\u2019re not even talking about a bit of Lorem Ipsum here and there, but full on pages, portfolio content and even products!\n\nThis is because many people buy pre-made themes, install a demo and it comes with so many pre-made templates that people just leave in the backend.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realise is that these pages then show up in Google search results and people find them while browsing their website and it\u2019s totally embarrassing. Plus, it completely screws up your SEO!\n\nHave a check \u2013 you may have \u201csample page\u201d still installed on your website, even if you didn\u2019t install a theme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also remove any unused plugins. These still cause performance and security issues even if they\u2019re not being used.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is probably the mildest of the mistakes on the list, but it\u2019s so common that we thought we\u2019d include it.\n\nA favicon is the little icon that comes up at the top of the browser tab. Most people forget to include a custom one with their WordPress website that the default one shows up.\n\nThis could mean that the WordPress logo is displayed, or the logo of the company who made the theme itself. Either way, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nRemember, this little favicon is a way for your brand to get easily recognised, especially when you\u2019re dealing with people who have multiple tabs open at a time!\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Favicons-1-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWordPress has seriously evolved in the last few years. What used to once be a blogging platform is now the world\u2019s most popular CMS, powering the websites of giants such as Disney and CNN.\n\nSince blogs used to all be about writing an opinion piece and then people leaving comments on said blog, naturally this is a feature built into WordPress.\n\nHowever, these days, all it does it attract spammers \u2013 people who leave comments on your site in order to give links back to a website that they\u2019re trying to promote.\n\nThis is actually a classic &lt;strong&gt;black hat SEO &lt;\/strong&gt;technique that people use and if you pay for cheap SEO services, this is likely the sort of thing they will be doing, claiming they got backlinks for you!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe\u2019re going to go into a few of the more technical mistakes now.\n\nWhen you first create a WordPress site, the default settings for your permalinks are pretty ugly! Even having the date in the URL isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nFor SEO purposes, you really want the post name, so that people can see what the page\/post is about right away.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5657\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Permalinks-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;798\&quot; height=\&quot;580\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nYou can change this in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks. Many people don\u2019t realise that this is customisable and leaves the default settings on and it\u2019s unpleasant for users.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nUnfortunately, even some of the top web design agencies in London do not know much about SEO, which we think is wrong.\n\nYes, they\u2019re very different professions, but we ensure that all our developers know the essentials of SEO or it can be detrimental to your website.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you also know a little bit, so that you can do some checks and also help your site rank in Google.\n\nOne of the biggest errors that we see all the time, which is super painful, is that when people get a new website designed, they don\u2019t transfer their SEO over.\n\nSo, a once high-ranking website, gets a brand new makeover, but then drops off the face of Google. It\u2019s riddled with 404 errors and no meta data.\n\nComplete nightmare.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking indexing\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nOn a related note, in order for your website to rank on Google, you need to ensure it\u2019s being indexed by search engines.\n\nIt\u2019s very normal that when you\u2019re building out a development site and it\u2019s not ready, you definitely do not want it to be indexed by Google.\n\nThere\u2019s a checkbox within the WordPress settings menu, under \u201cReading\u201d that allows you to check a box to discourage search engines from indexing the site. However, the better way to do this is via the robots.txt file, although this requires a bit more technicality to do it.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5660\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/SEV-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many people forget to uncheck this box after launching and wonder why their site is doing so badly in Google!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve seen it so much! When a client comes to us asking us to help with their marketing, once of the first things we ask for is access to analytics.\n\nSo many of them are not even aware it exists!\n\nThe best thing about digital is that it\u2019s all measurable. Why waste the opportunity by not installing it on your website?\n\nPlease note, do NOT install it with a plugin! You can take a piece of code snippet from within your Google Analytics dashboard that you can pop into your website.\n\nIf you do not have a Google Analytics account\u2026 then set one up now! You can get so much insight into your customers with it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nMost customers come to us and their site is so out of date!! They have multiple updates that they need doing and they have complaints that things are not working on their website.\n\nA lot of the time, the updates fix these issues!\n\nThe updates are done by the developers of the themes\/plugins to fix any bugs that have been found. So, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep your WordPress website up to date.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t update your WordPress website, it can leave it open to security vulnerabilities. So many hackers look for ways in due to problems in the code and will take any opportunity they can.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThis exhaustive list may put you off using WordPress since there are so many things that can go wrong! But there are also so many things that can go right!!\n\nIf you build your WordPress site right, you will a stunning website that runs fast, ranks really well on Google and is super easy to use in the backend. It will also give you so much opportunity to further develop your website and futureproof it.\n\nWe would always recommend using a WordPress specialist agency to build you a bespoke WordPress website so that you don\u2019t run into performance problems. WordPress is super easy to maintain, but it can be tricky to build out a good quality build from scratch without good skills.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wordpresshosting.support/_WordPress.html maintenance&lt;\/a&gt; is also quite time-consuming and so this is another service that you could leave to professionals to ensure that your WordPress site is also up to date and secure.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your WordPress website, you know how to get in touch!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;closed&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;closed&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;15-biggest-wordpress-mistakes-of-2022&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-21 15:59:27&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-21 15:59:27&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=5654&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/15-Biggest-WordPress-Mistakes-of-2022-780x520.webp&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s been a busy year for WordPress! Even more websites are powered by WordPress now \u2013 &lt;a href=../../_https_/blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-stats/_43.html of the internet, compared to 39.5% of the internet in 2021&lt;\/a&gt;!\n\nThis means that more users are creating WordPress websites, but this unfortunately means more mistakes are being made.\n\nThe majority of people making WordPress websites are not experts. The CMS is designed for those who don\u2019t have coding knowledge and so this isn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s worrying is that there are several WordPress agencies in London also making these basic mistakes! Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know who is truly a WordPress expert out there, even if they say they\u2019re a \u201ctop WordPress agency\u201d.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the biggest mistakes made in WordPress?&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we are dealing with hundreds of different WordPress websites every year, we thought we would put together an article to go through the top 15 mistakes that we\u2019ve seen with WordPress sites this year.\n\nSome of these WordPress mistakes have caused companies to lose their entire website, drop off the face of Google, lose thousands of pounds of revenue and one even lost their investment.\n\nSo, these errors can be detrimental, but yet many are very easy to fix.\n\nThere are in no particular order of severity, as you should really be doing them all :)\n&lt;div style=\&quot;border: 1px solid #fff; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px;\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\&quot;font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 2rem;\&quot;&gt;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022:&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;margin: 0; list-style-type: auto; list-style-position: inside;\&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#no-backups\&quot;&gt;No backups&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;Blocking indexing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe cannot believe we still see this one, as this has been an absolute \u201cno no\u201d with WordPress for decades now!\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve taken over several websites built by other agencies who has \u201cadmin\u201d as the username and we\u2019ve seen many developers who submit their trial task to us during the recruitment process do this rookie error too.\n\nSo, why is it so bad?\n\nWhen hackers try to get into a WordPress site, it\u2019s the first name they guess! Then, they use brute force attacks to try and guess your password. It might not sound likely that they\u2019ll get in, but bots are so powerful these days and they can guess millions of passwords per minute!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;no-backups\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No backups&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nIt should be a no-brainer to back up your website, just like with anything else. But yet people still don\u2019t do it. These are the same people who probably never back up their files on their computer, save documents while they\u2019re working on it or take out insurance.\n\nThey never think it will happen to them, but cry and curse when it does!\n\nBack in the day, backups were fairly expensive. Companies used to rip you off as they know how important they are. But now, all good hosting companies should offer free backup solutions. And they should be daily too.\n\nIf you are a company who regularly updates your website, the last thing you want to do is end up re-doing all those changes if something goes wrong.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve had to repair the styling of multiple WordPress websites because there is no child theme\u2026 AND\u2026 no backup!! Crazy crazy crazy!\n\nNot sure what a child theme even is? Then, you probably don\u2019t have one, unless your site was built by a professional.\n\nA child theme is a copy of the \u201cparent\u201d theme, which is the main theme you installed when building your WordPress website. The child theme will have all of the same features, functionalities and styles as the parent theme when you create it.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that when you update the theme, you override all the files in the theme folder, but the ones in the child theme remain.\n\nTherefore, whenever you make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;\/em&gt; changes to the theme, which includes all your styling \u2013 colours, fonts etc. then all this will disappear when you update the website.\n\nWe often hear people scared of updating their website because it \u201cbreaks\u201d the site, but this is usually the reason why!\n\nThere are some additional reasons why websites can break after updates, which we will cover a bit later.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is definitely the most common mistake we see in WordPress websites. In fact, we think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;\/em&gt; website that has ever come to us uses too many plugins!!\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to install a bunch of plugins to get lots of cool functionality on your website, but this just causes a whole host of problems.\n\nEach plugin massively slows down your website, causing performance problems, and increasing the carbon output. This is not good if you want to have a sustainable website.\n\nIt also comes with security issues \u2013 hackers find vulnerabilities in plugins, exploit them, and then destroy your website. This is why it\u2019s also essential to update your WordPress website regularly! More on that later!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nPlugins are dangerous territory if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! We already know that problems occur when you add too many plugins to your website, but there are also \u201cbad\u201d plugins to install too.\n\nWith a &lt;a href=../../_https_/kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/_database.html of 55,000+ plugins&lt;\/a&gt;, (and the rest from other sources), it\u2019s difficult to know which ones you shouldn\u2019t install.\n\nFirst of all, you should only be installing plugins when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5659\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Plugins-1-800x423.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;423\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nSecondly, there are signs to look out for when you\u2019re installing a plugin: When was the last time it was updated? How many downloads has it had? What are the reviews like?\n\nIf you have a plugin with thousands of downloads from happy customers and you can see it\u2019s recently been updated, you\u2019re less likely to run into any problems. If a plugin has decent reviews but hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, it can still pose security risks considering technology progresses very quickly.\n\nPlus, many plugins cause conflicts with each other. If you install a particular plugin, it could end up stopping another plugin from running, so you need to ensure that you test out the plugins on a &lt;strong&gt;test server&lt;\/strong&gt; first.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis one is going to surprise (and annoy) a lot of you.\n\nPage builders are bad.\n\nThere, we said it.\n\nYes, they help people edit their own sites nice and easily, but they\u2019re also terrible for performance. Each page builder adds functionality to the website using really bloated code and often introduce HTML errors that are impossible to fix.\n\nIt also goes against sustainable web design practice and your website will be a lot less green because of it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWhile we\u2019re talking about green websites and performance, let\u2019s talk about the number one culprit for slow websites \u2013 large images.\n\nEven if you were to run your own website through &lt;a href=../../_http_/pagespeed.web.dev/_Google/u2019s.html PageSpeeds&lt;\/a&gt;, the top result is likely to come back with \u201ccompress your images\u201d.\n\nThe problem is, if you want your website to look nice, then you want nice images on it. We get it. These nice images usually have huge files sizes too!\n\nBut you can size them down and compress them without losing quality before uploading them to your website.\n\nMost people don\u2019t do this.\n\nSome people are somewhere in the middle and use a plugin to compress their images for them. This is lazy and simply not good enough!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nDo you know how many websites we see that still have dummy data on their website? We\u2019re not even talking about a bit of Lorem Ipsum here and there, but full on pages, portfolio content and even products!\n\nThis is because many people buy pre-made themes, install a demo and it comes with so many pre-made templates that people just leave in the backend.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realise is that these pages then show up in Google search results and people find them while browsing their website and it\u2019s totally embarrassing. Plus, it completely screws up your SEO!\n\nHave a check \u2013 you may have \u201csample page\u201d still installed on your website, even if you didn\u2019t install a theme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also remove any unused plugins. These still cause performance and security issues even if they\u2019re not being used.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is probably the mildest of the mistakes on the list, but it\u2019s so common that we thought we\u2019d include it.\n\nA favicon is the little icon that comes up at the top of the browser tab. Most people forget to include a custom one with their WordPress website that the default one shows up.\n\nThis could mean that the WordPress logo is displayed, or the logo of the company who made the theme itself. Either way, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nRemember, this little favicon is a way for your brand to get easily recognised, especially when you\u2019re dealing with people who have multiple tabs open at a time!\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Favicons-1-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWordPress has seriously evolved in the last few years. What used to once be a blogging platform is now the world\u2019s most popular CMS, powering the websites of giants such as Disney and CNN.\n\nSince blogs used to all be about writing an opinion piece and then people leaving comments on said blog, naturally this is a feature built into WordPress.\n\nHowever, these days, all it does it attract spammers \u2013 people who leave comments on your site in order to give links back to a website that they\u2019re trying to promote.\n\nThis is actually a classic &lt;strong&gt;black hat SEO &lt;\/strong&gt;technique that people use and if you pay for cheap SEO services, this is likely the sort of thing they will be doing, claiming they got backlinks for you!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe\u2019re going to go into a few of the more technical mistakes now.\n\nWhen you first create a WordPress site, the default settings for your permalinks are pretty ugly! Even having the date in the URL isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nFor SEO purposes, you really want the post name, so that people can see what the page\/post is about right away.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5657\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Permalinks-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;798\&quot; height=\&quot;580\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nYou can change this in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks.

It\u2019s riddled with 404 errors and no meta data.\n\nComplete nightmare.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking indexing\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nOn a related note, in order for your website to rank on Google, you need to ensure it\u2019s being indexed by search engines.\n\nIt\u2019s very normal that when you\u2019re building out a development site and it\u2019s not ready, you definitely do not want it to be indexed by Google.\n\nThere\u2019s a checkbox within the WordPress settings menu, under \u201cReading\u201d that allows you to check a box to discourage search engines from indexing the site. However, the better way to do this is via the robots.txt file, although this requires a bit more technicality to do it.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5660\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/SEV-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many people forget to uncheck this box after launching and wonder why their site is doing so badly in Google!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve seen it so much! When a client comes to us asking us to help with their marketing, once of the first things we ask for is access to analytics.\n\nSo many of them are not even aware it exists!\n\nThe best thing about digital is that it\u2019s all measurable. Why waste the opportunity by not installing it on your website?\n\nPlease note, do NOT install it with a plugin! You can take a piece of code snippet from within your Google Analytics dashboard that you can pop into your website.\n\nIf you do not have a Google Analytics account\u2026 then set one up now! You can get so much insight into your customers with it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nMost customers come to us and their site is so out of date!! They have multiple updates that they need doing and they have complaints that things are not working on their website.\n\nA lot of the time, the updates fix these issues!\n\nThe updates are done by the developers of the themes\/plugins to fix any bugs that have been found. So, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep your WordPress website up to date.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t update your WordPress website, it can leave it open to security vulnerabilities. So many hackers look for ways in due to problems in the code and will take any opportunity they can.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThis exhaustive list may put you off using WordPress since there are so many things that can go wrong! But there are also so many things that can go right!!\n\nIf you build your WordPress site right, you will a stunning website that runs fast, ranks really well on Google and is super easy to use in the backend. It will also give you so much opportunity to further develop your website and futureproof it.\n\nWe would always recommend using a WordPress specialist agency to build you a bespoke WordPress website so that you don\u2019t run into performance problems. WordPress is super easy to maintain, but it can be tricky to build out a good quality build from scratch without good skills.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wordpresshosting.support/_WordPress.html maintenance&lt;\/a&gt; is also quite time-consuming and so this is another service that you could leave to professionals to ensure that your WordPress site is also up to date and secure.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your WordPress website, you know how to get in touch!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s been a busy year for WordPress! Even more websites are powered by WordPress now \u2013 43.2% of the internet, compared to 39.5% of the internet in 2021! This means [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/15-biggest-wordpress-mistakes-of-2022\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3934,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;6th December 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-12-06 09:00:39&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;The holiday season is here, and that means a flurry of shoppers looking to find the perfect gift. That also means it\u2019s a busy time of year for e-commerce businesses. Whether you're a big brand or just starting out online, here are some tips to make sure your online store is ready for the Christmas rush:\n&lt;h2&gt;Make sure your website is performing well&lt;\/h2&gt;\nIf you\u2019re going to spend all that time promoting your website to get sales, &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/our-top-5-ways-to-speed-up-a-wordpress-website/_you.html better make sure that your website can handle them!&lt;\/a&gt;\n\nIt\u2019s sensible to run a bunch of tests to ensure that not only the site performs as it should and there are no errors along the way, but that the &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/essential-ux-elements-for-a-sucessful-ecommerce-website/_user.html experience&lt;\/a&gt; is also a pleasant one! While people are busy stressing over what to buy loved ones for Christmas, they don\u2019t want to have a confusing website, or that will frustrate them more.\n\nEnsure you have dedicated landing pages for different categories (this will help your ad campaigns too), and a search function which works intuitively.\n\nIf you feel that your website is running slow, then definitely invest in a professional to help you optimise your site as you do not want to be wasting valuable opportunities at this time of year. They should also ensure that your security is up to scratch too, so this gives buyers confidence in your online store.\n&lt;h2&gt;Update opening hours and delivery windows&lt;\/h2&gt;\nGet the word out to your buyers that you\u2019re open for business! This means utilising social media and email marketing to your advantage.\n\nBe really clear about your opening times, both online and if you have a physical store and what the last date is they need to order to get their gifts in time for Christmas. We\u2019d also give it some extra days for good measure due to those annoying Royal Mail strikes.\n\nMake sure this date is very clear on the website and all your social channels to avoid disappointment. It is also wise to update your refund\/returns policy, as well as your delivery policy so people understand how you will operate around the Christmas period and what happens if they do not receive their gifts on time.\n&lt;h2&gt;Get festive&lt;\/h2&gt;\nEveryone loves coming to an &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/woocommerce-v-shopify/_e-commerce/a.html store that\u2019s decorated in the theme of that holiday period, and Christmas is the one time of the year where they &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;\/em&gt; it.\n\nHow soon is too soon to get festive? Well, that one is always up for debate, but we say that as soon as it hits December, you\u2019re pretty safe to do it without anyone getting too offended.\n\nIf you have a physical store, try to decorate them both in a similar style, so you can have a consistent brand.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have time to create a festive photoshoot with your products, you can get creative with Photoshop! Or at least decorate the rest of the website! Plus, you can save that version of the website and just bring it out every year, saving you money on future web development costs!\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Not sure about promotions?&lt;\/strong&gt; We feel you. This year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday has received a lot of backlash. But, with the &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/how-will-marketing-change-in-a-recession/_cost.html of living crisis&lt;\/a&gt;, we think that people will still appreciate a nice offer that will save them money. You can still be tasteful with it.\n&lt;h2&gt;Create a Gift Guide&lt;\/h2&gt;\nA nice idea is to create a gift guide, especially for different categories. This is a great way for shoppers to get quick inspiration. You can do yours in the form of a web page for reach, or even as a PDF too so it\u2019s easily shareable.\n\nJust make sure that each gift links back to your chosen product on the website, making it super easy for your customers to make the purchase.\n\nYou can also do this with social media too, so you can integrate the shopping experience without them needing to leave the platform.\n&lt;h2&gt;Use Christmas hashtags and trending topics on social media&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThere are two ways to use hashtags and trending topics on social media to promote your products. The first is to simply use them as a form of communication, so that people who are interested in talking about Christmas can find you and purchase something from your store.\n\nThe second way is more involved\u2014and it's what we'll be discussing here. By using hashtags related to Christmas as a part of your marketing strategy, you'll be able to reach a wider audience than just people who want to talk about Christmas. In addition, because it's currently trending online, this type of hashtag can help build buzz around one specific product or service rather than being spread out among various products and services like most traditional advertising strategies would suggest (at least until those other ones become popular enough).\n\nWhen working with these types of hashtags, however, remember not only the number but also the tone: don't overdo it! Just because there's an entire month dedicated towards promoting something doesn't mean that every single post needs its own unique hashtag; instead, just include one or two relevant ones at most per post (since there will already be plenty of other posts being shared throughout this time period).\n\nAnd make sure not only that they fit well within their context but also are appropriate for anyone else who may see them\u2014you wouldn't want anyone else getting confused between what yours means versus another person using theirs when they're actually talking about something entirely different!\n&lt;h2&gt;Run a 12 days of Christmas&lt;\/h2&gt;\nLots of brands like doing a 12 days of Christmas countdown and there\u2019s no set time for when you need to do it either. You can use this time to perhaps promote 12 key products you\u2019re selling, or even run promotions on each day, which creates that sense of urgency to drive sales.\n\nAlternatively, you can run a giveaway across those 12 days and drive traffic to your website as well as growing your social media following at the same time.\n&lt;h2&gt;Make your customers feel special&lt;\/h2&gt;\nAt the end of the day, &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/15-essentials-for-your-ecommerce-website/_this.html e-commerce website&lt;\/a&gt; shopping experience should be all about your customers rather than yourself. So, you need to make them feel special.\n\nThis means, in all of your comms, make sure you take the personal approach, rather than a spammy one. Everyone knows that people send out marketing emails, but if it\u2019s personalised to you and perhaps even suggests products based on your past orders, then this will more likely convert to sales.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you add a loyalty scheme if you don\u2019t already have one? And if you do, offer bonus points on Christmas purchases. This is another way to get around feeling dirty when doing promotions.\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\nWe know that you need to make money from your e-commerce store, but it\u2019s a tough world out there right now. So, we hope this e-commerce guide to Christmas will help you come up with some ideas that will work for your own store.\nHowever, if you ever need any help, you know where to find us!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;E-Commerce Guide to Christmas&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;e-commerce-guide-to-christmas&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:00:47&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:00:47&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3934&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/e-commerce-guide-to-xmas-780x520-1-780x520.webp&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s been a busy year for WordPress! Even more websites are powered by WordPress now \u2013 &lt;a href=../../_https_/blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-stats/_43.html of the internet, compared to 39.5% of the internet in 2021&lt;\/a&gt;!\n\nThis means that more users are creating WordPress websites, but this unfortunately means more mistakes are being made.\n\nThe majority of people making WordPress websites are not experts. The CMS is designed for those who don\u2019t have coding knowledge and so this isn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s worrying is that there are several WordPress agencies in London also making these basic mistakes! Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know who is truly a WordPress expert out there, even if they say they\u2019re a \u201ctop WordPress agency\u201d.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the biggest mistakes made in WordPress?&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we are dealing with hundreds of different WordPress websites every year, we thought we would put together an article to go through the top 15 mistakes that we\u2019ve seen with WordPress sites this year.\n\nSome of these WordPress mistakes have caused companies to lose their entire website, drop off the face of Google, lose thousands of pounds of revenue and one even lost their investment.\n\nSo, these errors can be detrimental, but yet many are very easy to fix.\n\nThere are in no particular order of severity, as you should really be doing them all :)\n&lt;div style=\&quot;border: 1px solid #fff; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px;\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\&quot;font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 2rem;\&quot;&gt;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022:&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;margin: 0; list-style-type: auto; list-style-position: inside;\&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#no-backups\&quot;&gt;No backups&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;Blocking indexing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe cannot believe we still see this one, as this has been an absolute \u201cno no\u201d with WordPress for decades now!\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve taken over several websites built by other agencies who has \u201cadmin\u201d as the username and we\u2019ve seen many developers who submit their trial task to us during the recruitment process do this rookie error too.\n\nSo, why is it so bad?\n\nWhen hackers try to get into a WordPress site, it\u2019s the first name they guess! Then, they use brute force attacks to try and guess your password. It might not sound likely that they\u2019ll get in, but bots are so powerful these days and they can guess millions of passwords per minute!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;no-backups\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No backups&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nIt should be a no-brainer to back up your website, just like with anything else. But yet people still don\u2019t do it. These are the same people who probably never back up their files on their computer, save documents while they\u2019re working on it or take out insurance.\n\nThey never think it will happen to them, but cry and curse when it does!\n\nBack in the day, backups were fairly expensive. Companies used to rip you off as they know how important they are. But now, all good hosting companies should offer free backup solutions. And they should be daily too.\n\nIf you are a company who regularly updates your website, the last thing you want to do is end up re-doing all those changes if something goes wrong.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve had to repair the styling of multiple WordPress websites because there is no child theme\u2026 AND\u2026 no backup!! Crazy crazy crazy!\n\nNot sure what a child theme even is? Then, you probably don\u2019t have one, unless your site was built by a professional.\n\nA child theme is a copy of the \u201cparent\u201d theme, which is the main theme you installed when building your WordPress website. The child theme will have all of the same features, functionalities and styles as the parent theme when you create it.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that when you update the theme, you override all the files in the theme folder, but the ones in the child theme remain.\n\nTherefore, whenever you make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;\/em&gt; changes to the theme, which includes all your styling \u2013 colours, fonts etc. then all this will disappear when you update the website.\n\nWe often hear people scared of updating their website because it \u201cbreaks\u201d the site, but this is usually the reason why!\n\nThere are some additional reasons why websites can break after updates, which we will cover a bit later.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is definitely the most common mistake we see in WordPress websites. In fact, we think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;\/em&gt; website that has ever come to us uses too many plugins!!\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to install a bunch of plugins to get lots of cool functionality on your website, but this just causes a whole host of problems.\n\nEach plugin massively slows down your website, causing performance problems, and increasing the carbon output. This is not good if you want to have a sustainable website.\n\nIt also comes with security issues \u2013 hackers find vulnerabilities in plugins, exploit them, and then destroy your website. This is why it\u2019s also essential to update your WordPress website regularly! More on that later!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nPlugins are dangerous territory if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! We already know that problems occur when you add too many plugins to your website, but there are also \u201cbad\u201d plugins to install too.\n\nWith a &lt;a href=../../_https_/kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/_database.html of 55,000+ plugins&lt;\/a&gt;, (and the rest from other sources), it\u2019s difficult to know which ones you shouldn\u2019t install.\n\nFirst of all, you should only be installing plugins when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5659\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Plugins-1-800x423.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;423\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nSecondly, there are signs to look out for when you\u2019re installing a plugin: When was the last time it was updated? How many downloads has it had? What are the reviews like?\n\nIf you have a plugin with thousands of downloads from happy customers and you can see it\u2019s recently been updated, you\u2019re less likely to run into any problems. If a plugin has decent reviews but hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, it can still pose security risks considering technology progresses very quickly.\n\nPlus, many plugins cause conflicts with each other. If you install a particular plugin, it could end up stopping another plugin from running, so you need to ensure that you test out the plugins on a &lt;strong&gt;test server&lt;\/strong&gt; first.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis one is going to surprise (and annoy) a lot of you.\n\nPage builders are bad.\n\nThere, we said it.\n\nYes, they help people edit their own sites nice and easily, but they\u2019re also terrible for performance. Each page builder adds functionality to the website using really bloated code and often introduce HTML errors that are impossible to fix.\n\nIt also goes against sustainable web design practice and your website will be a lot less green because of it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWhile we\u2019re talking about green websites and performance, let\u2019s talk about the number one culprit for slow websites \u2013 large images.\n\nEven if you were to run your own website through &lt;a href=../../_http_/pagespeed.web.dev/_Google/u2019s.html PageSpeeds&lt;\/a&gt;, the top result is likely to come back with \u201ccompress your images\u201d.\n\nThe problem is, if you want your website to look nice, then you want nice images on it. We get it. These nice images usually have huge files sizes too!\n\nBut you can size them down and compress them without losing quality before uploading them to your website.\n\nMost people don\u2019t do this.\n\nSome people are somewhere in the middle and use a plugin to compress their images for them. This is lazy and simply not good enough!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nDo you know how many websites we see that still have dummy data on their website? We\u2019re not even talking about a bit of Lorem Ipsum here and there, but full on pages, portfolio content and even products!\n\nThis is because many people buy pre-made themes, install a demo and it comes with so many pre-made templates that people just leave in the backend.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realise is that these pages then show up in Google search results and people find them while browsing their website and it\u2019s totally embarrassing. Plus, it completely screws up your SEO!\n\nHave a check \u2013 you may have \u201csample page\u201d still installed on your website, even if you didn\u2019t install a theme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also remove any unused plugins. These still cause performance and security issues even if they\u2019re not being used.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is probably the mildest of the mistakes on the list, but it\u2019s so common that we thought we\u2019d include it.\n\nA favicon is the little icon that comes up at the top of the browser tab. Most people forget to include a custom one with their WordPress website that the default one shows up.\n\nThis could mean that the WordPress logo is displayed, or the logo of the company who made the theme itself. Either way, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nRemember, this little favicon is a way for your brand to get easily recognised, especially when you\u2019re dealing with people who have multiple tabs open at a time!\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Favicons-1-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWordPress has seriously evolved in the last few years. What used to once be a blogging platform is now the world\u2019s most popular CMS, powering the websites of giants such as Disney and CNN.\n\nSince blogs used to all be about writing an opinion piece and then people leaving comments on said blog, naturally this is a feature built into WordPress.\n\nHowever, these days, all it does it attract spammers \u2013 people who leave comments on your site in order to give links back to a website that they\u2019re trying to promote.\n\nThis is actually a classic &lt;strong&gt;black hat SEO &lt;\/strong&gt;technique that people use and if you pay for cheap SEO services, this is likely the sort of thing they will be doing, claiming they got backlinks for you!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe\u2019re going to go into a few of the more technical mistakes now.\n\nWhen you first create a WordPress site, the default settings for your permalinks are pretty ugly! Even having the date in the URL isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nFor SEO purposes, you really want the post name, so that people can see what the page\/post is about right away.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5657\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Permalinks-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;798\&quot; height=\&quot;580\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nYou can change this in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks. Many people don\u2019t realise that this is customisable and leaves the default settings on and it\u2019s unpleasant for users.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nUnfortunately, even some of the top web design agencies in London do not know much about SEO, which we think is wrong.\n\nYes, they\u2019re very different professions, but we ensure that all our developers know the essentials of SEO or it can be detrimental to your website.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you also know a little bit, so that you can do some checks and also help your site rank in Google.\n\nOne of the biggest errors that we see all the time, which is super painful, is that when people get a new website designed, they don\u2019t transfer their SEO over.\n\nSo, a once high-ranking website, gets a brand new makeover, but then drops off the face of Google. It\u2019s riddled with 404 errors and no meta data.\n\nComplete nightmare.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking indexing\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nOn a related note, in order for your website to rank on Google, you need to ensure it\u2019s being indexed by search engines.\n\nIt\u2019s very normal that when you\u2019re building out a development site and it\u2019s not ready, you definitely do not want it to be indexed by Google.\n\nThere\u2019s a checkbox within the WordPress settings menu, under \u201cReading\u201d that allows you to check a box to discourage search engines from indexing the site. However, the better way to do this is via the robots.txt file, although this requires a bit more technicality to do it.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5660\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/SEV-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many people forget to uncheck this box after launching and wonder why their site is doing so badly in Google!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve seen it so much! When a client comes to us asking us to help with their marketing, once of the first things we ask for is access to analytics.\n\nSo many of them are not even aware it exists!\n\nThe best thing about digital is that it\u2019s all measurable. Why waste the opportunity by not installing it on your website?\n\nPlease note, do NOT install it with a plugin! You can take a piece of code snippet from within your Google Analytics dashboard that you can pop into your website.\n\nIf you do not have a Google Analytics account\u2026 then set one up now! You can get so much insight into your customers with it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nMost customers come to us and their site is so out of date!! They have multiple updates that they need doing and they have complaints that things are not working on their website.\n\nA lot of the time, the updates fix these issues!\n\nThe updates are done by the developers of the themes\/plugins to fix any bugs that have been found. So, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep your WordPress website up to date.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t update your WordPress website, it can leave it open to security vulnerabilities. So many hackers look for ways in due to problems in the code and will take any opportunity they can.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThis exhaustive list may put you off using WordPress since there are so many things that can go wrong! But there are also so many things that can go right!!\n\nIf you build your WordPress site right, you will a stunning website that runs fast, ranks really well on Google and is super easy to use in the backend. It will also give you so much opportunity to further develop your website and futureproof it.\n\nWe would always recommend using a WordPress specialist agency to build you a bespoke WordPress website so that you don\u2019t run into performance problems. WordPress is super easy to maintain, but it can be tricky to build out a good quality build from scratch without good skills.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wordpresshosting.support/_WordPress.html maintenance&lt;\/a&gt; is also quite time-consuming and so this is another service that you could leave to professionals to ensure that your WordPress site is also up to date and secure.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your WordPress website, you know how to get in touch!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;E-Commerce Guide to Christmas&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;The holiday season is here, and that means a flurry of shoppers looking to find the perfect gift. That also means it\u2019s a busy time of year for e-commerce businesses. [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/e-commerce-guide-to-christmas\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3937,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;15th November 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-11-15 10:36:49&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s often a case of Cobbler\u2019s Shoes when it comes to a web design agency trying to design their own website. Many just abandon the idea of trying to do something fancy because they simply don\u2019t have the time.\n\n&lt;em&gt;Clients come first.&lt;\/em&gt;\n\nThat\u2019s what most agencies say\u2026 but what they really mean is &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;\/strong&gt; comes first. They will always put paid work over internal projects.\n\nSo, why are we different?!\n&lt;h2&gt;It\u2019s all about the environment&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThe main reason we are embarking on this website redesign journey is because we have been practising sustainable web design now for a couple of years.\n\nWe have been learning more and more about how to reduce the amount of carbon emitted from websites and produce sustainable websites.\n\nEach website project we\u2019ve done so far using sustainable web design practices has saved &lt;em&gt;over 150kg of carbon&lt;\/em&gt; per year!! This means, around 10 trees have been saved per year as a result of us rebuilding the website.\n\nThis is what we want to achieve with our website.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about making it low-carbon, lightweight and high performance, but we also want it to look amazing! Because it\u2019s easy to create a low-carbon website that\u2019s mainly text-based. But what about one with tons of custom graphics and animations?\n\nWe are all about practising what we preach!\n\nWhat\u2019s a better way to show that we are able to design and build you a bespoke WordPress website that\u2019s low carbon than to do it for ourselves?\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the effort to spend the best part of 2022 working on this website redesign project.\n&lt;h2&gt;Your website should always be about the user&lt;\/h2&gt;\nUser experience &lt;em&gt;should&lt;\/em&gt; be the number one concern when it comes to website design. However, most of the time, it\u2019s just one thing on a long list of requirements. The majority of companies only care about aesthetics and trying to think of ways to increase lead generation.\n\nBut if you concentrate on user experience, then it should take into account all the other \u201cfancy\u201d features, but with the customer in mind.\n\nWe have been speaking to our website users and they have told us that they mainly want more information about our services and easier access to our blogs. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning to do!\n&lt;h2&gt;Content is King&lt;\/h2&gt;\nYes, content is still king! To be fair, we don\u2019t think it will be knocked off its throne any time soon.\n\nWe spend a lot of time creating content to help our other small businesses and entrepreneurs with marketing help, website tips and design trends. Therefore, we want to make sure that our new website allows easy access to this content!\n\nAt the moment, the blog is hidden away and the articles are not that accessible, so we will be re-designing that with the user in mind too.\n\nWe are not quite ready to show the world yet, but the aim is to get the new site up just before Christmas! So, stay tuned for more information about the progress!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;Why are we re-designing our own website?!&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;why-are-we-re-designing-our-own-website&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:02&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:02&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3937&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/cc-website-blog-1-780x520.jpg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:29,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:29,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:29,&quot;category_count&quot;:10,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:25,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:25,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:12,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:25,&quot;category_count&quot;:12,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:32,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sustainability&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;sustainability&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:32,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:11,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:32,&quot;category_count&quot;:11,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Sustainability&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;sustainability&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s been a busy year for WordPress! Even more websites are powered by WordPress now \u2013 &lt;a href=../../_https_/blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-stats/_43.html of the internet, compared to 39.5% of the internet in 2021&lt;\/a&gt;!\n\nThis means that more users are creating WordPress websites, but this unfortunately means more mistakes are being made.\n\nThe majority of people making WordPress websites are not experts. The CMS is designed for those who don\u2019t have coding knowledge and so this isn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s worrying is that there are several WordPress agencies in London also making these basic mistakes! Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know who is truly a WordPress expert out there, even if they say they\u2019re a \u201ctop WordPress agency\u201d.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the biggest mistakes made in WordPress?&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we are dealing with hundreds of different WordPress websites every year, we thought we would put together an article to go through the top 15 mistakes that we\u2019ve seen with WordPress sites this year.\n\nSome of these WordPress mistakes have caused companies to lose their entire website, drop off the face of Google, lose thousands of pounds of revenue and one even lost their investment.\n\nSo, these errors can be detrimental, but yet many are very easy to fix.\n\nThere are in no particular order of severity, as you should really be doing them all :)\n&lt;div style=\&quot;border: 1px solid #fff; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px;\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\&quot;font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 2rem;\&quot;&gt;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022:&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;margin: 0; list-style-type: auto; list-style-position: inside;\&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#no-backups\&quot;&gt;No backups&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;Blocking indexing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe cannot believe we still see this one, as this has been an absolute \u201cno no\u201d with WordPress for decades now!\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve taken over several websites built by other agencies who has \u201cadmin\u201d as the username and we\u2019ve seen many developers who submit their trial task to us during the recruitment process do this rookie error too.\n\nSo, why is it so bad?\n\nWhen hackers try to get into a WordPress site, it\u2019s the first name they guess! Then, they use brute force attacks to try and guess your password. It might not sound likely that they\u2019ll get in, but bots are so powerful these days and they can guess millions of passwords per minute!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;no-backups\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No backups&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nIt should be a no-brainer to back up your website, just like with anything else. But yet people still don\u2019t do it. These are the same people who probably never back up their files on their computer, save documents while they\u2019re working on it or take out insurance.\n\nThey never think it will happen to them, but cry and curse when it does!\n\nBack in the day, backups were fairly expensive. Companies used to rip you off as they know how important they are. But now, all good hosting companies should offer free backup solutions. And they should be daily too.\n\nIf you are a company who regularly updates your website, the last thing you want to do is end up re-doing all those changes if something goes wrong.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve had to repair the styling of multiple WordPress websites because there is no child theme\u2026 AND\u2026 no backup!! Crazy crazy crazy!\n\nNot sure what a child theme even is? Then, you probably don\u2019t have one, unless your site was built by a professional.\n\nA child theme is a copy of the \u201cparent\u201d theme, which is the main theme you installed when building your WordPress website. The child theme will have all of the same features, functionalities and styles as the parent theme when you create it.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that when you update the theme, you override all the files in the theme folder, but the ones in the child theme remain.\n\nTherefore, whenever you make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;\/em&gt; changes to the theme, which includes all your styling \u2013 colours, fonts etc. then all this will disappear when you update the website.\n\nWe often hear people scared of updating their website because it \u201cbreaks\u201d the site, but this is usually the reason why!\n\nThere are some additional reasons why websites can break after updates, which we will cover a bit later.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is definitely the most common mistake we see in WordPress websites. In fact, we think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;\/em&gt; website that has ever come to us uses too many plugins!!\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to install a bunch of plugins to get lots of cool functionality on your website, but this just causes a whole host of problems.\n\nEach plugin massively slows down your website, causing performance problems, and increasing the carbon output. This is not good if you want to have a sustainable website.\n\nIt also comes with security issues \u2013 hackers find vulnerabilities in plugins, exploit them, and then destroy your website. This is why it\u2019s also essential to update your WordPress website regularly! More on that later!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nPlugins are dangerous territory if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! We already know that problems occur when you add too many plugins to your website, but there are also \u201cbad\u201d plugins to install too.\n\nWith a &lt;a href=../../_https_/kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/_database.html of 55,000+ plugins&lt;\/a&gt;, (and the rest from other sources), it\u2019s difficult to know which ones you shouldn\u2019t install.\n\nFirst of all, you should only be installing plugins when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5659\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Plugins-1-800x423.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;423\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nSecondly, there are signs to look out for when you\u2019re installing a plugin: When was the last time it was updated? How many downloads has it had? What are the reviews like?\n\nIf you have a plugin with thousands of downloads from happy customers and you can see it\u2019s recently been updated, you\u2019re less likely to run into any problems. If a plugin has decent reviews but hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, it can still pose security risks considering technology progresses very quickly.\n\nPlus, many plugins cause conflicts with each other. If you install a particular plugin, it could end up stopping another plugin from running, so you need to ensure that you test out the plugins on a &lt;strong&gt;test server&lt;\/strong&gt; first.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis one is going to surprise (and annoy) a lot of you.\n\nPage builders are bad.\n\nThere, we said it.\n\nYes, they help people edit their own sites nice and easily, but they\u2019re also terrible for performance. Each page builder adds functionality to the website using really bloated code and often introduce HTML errors that are impossible to fix.\n\nIt also goes against sustainable web design practice and your website will be a lot less green because of it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWhile we\u2019re talking about green websites and performance, let\u2019s talk about the number one culprit for slow websites \u2013 large images.\n\nEven if you were to run your own website through &lt;a href=../../_http_/pagespeed.web.dev/_Google/u2019s.html PageSpeeds&lt;\/a&gt;, the top result is likely to come back with \u201ccompress your images\u201d.\n\nThe problem is, if you want your website to look nice, then you want nice images on it. We get it. These nice images usually have huge files sizes too!\n\nBut you can size them down and compress them without losing quality before uploading them to your website.\n\nMost people don\u2019t do this.\n\nSome people are somewhere in the middle and use a plugin to compress their images for them. This is lazy and simply not good enough!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nDo you know how many websites we see that still have dummy data on their website? We\u2019re not even talking about a bit of Lorem Ipsum here and there, but full on pages, portfolio content and even products!\n\nThis is because many people buy pre-made themes, install a demo and it comes with so many pre-made templates that people just leave in the backend.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realise is that these pages then show up in Google search results and people find them while browsing their website and it\u2019s totally embarrassing. Plus, it completely screws up your SEO!\n\nHave a check \u2013 you may have \u201csample page\u201d still installed on your website, even if you didn\u2019t install a theme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also remove any unused plugins. These still cause performance and security issues even if they\u2019re not being used.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is probably the mildest of the mistakes on the list, but it\u2019s so common that we thought we\u2019d include it.\n\nA favicon is the little icon that comes up at the top of the browser tab. Most people forget to include a custom one with their WordPress website that the default one shows up.\n\nThis could mean that the WordPress logo is displayed, or the logo of the company who made the theme itself. Either way, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nRemember, this little favicon is a way for your brand to get easily recognised, especially when you\u2019re dealing with people who have multiple tabs open at a time!\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Favicons-1-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWordPress has seriously evolved in the last few years. What used to once be a blogging platform is now the world\u2019s most popular CMS, powering the websites of giants such as Disney and CNN.\n\nSince blogs used to all be about writing an opinion piece and then people leaving comments on said blog, naturally this is a feature built into WordPress.\n\nHowever, these days, all it does it attract spammers \u2013 people who leave comments on your site in order to give links back to a website that they\u2019re trying to promote.\n\nThis is actually a classic &lt;strong&gt;black hat SEO &lt;\/strong&gt;technique that people use and if you pay for cheap SEO services, this is likely the sort of thing they will be doing, claiming they got backlinks for you!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe\u2019re going to go into a few of the more technical mistakes now.\n\nWhen you first create a WordPress site, the default settings for your permalinks are pretty ugly! Even having the date in the URL isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nFor SEO purposes, you really want the post name, so that people can see what the page\/post is about right away.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5657\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Permalinks-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;798\&quot; height=\&quot;580\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nYou can change this in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks. Many people don\u2019t realise that this is customisable and leaves the default settings on and it\u2019s unpleasant for users.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nUnfortunately, even some of the top web design agencies in London do not know much about SEO, which we think is wrong.\n\nYes, they\u2019re very different professions, but we ensure that all our developers know the essentials of SEO or it can be detrimental to your website.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you also know a little bit, so that you can do some checks and also help your site rank in Google.\n\nOne of the biggest errors that we see all the time, which is super painful, is that when people get a new website designed, they don\u2019t transfer their SEO over.\n\nSo, a once high-ranking website, gets a brand new makeover, but then drops off the face of Google. It\u2019s riddled with 404 errors and no meta data.\n\nComplete nightmare.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking indexing\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nOn a related note, in order for your website to rank on Google, you need to ensure it\u2019s being indexed by search engines.\n\nIt\u2019s very normal that when you\u2019re building out a development site and it\u2019s not ready, you definitely do not want it to be indexed by Google.\n\nThere\u2019s a checkbox within the WordPress settings menu, under \u201cReading\u201d that allows you to check a box to discourage search engines from indexing the site. However, the better way to do this is via the robots.txt file, although this requires a bit more technicality to do it.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5660\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/SEV-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many people forget to uncheck this box after launching and wonder why their site is doing so badly in Google!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve seen it so much! When a client comes to us asking us to help with their marketing, once of the first things we ask for is access to analytics.\n\nSo many of them are not even aware it exists!\n\nThe best thing about digital is that it\u2019s all measurable. Why waste the opportunity by not installing it on your website?\n\nPlease note, do NOT install it with a plugin! You can take a piece of code snippet from within your Google Analytics dashboard that you can pop into your website.\n\nIf you do not have a Google Analytics account\u2026 then set one up now! You can get so much insight into your customers with it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nMost customers come to us and their site is so out of date!! They have multiple updates that they need doing and they have complaints that things are not working on their website.\n\nA lot of the time, the updates fix these issues!\n\nThe updates are done by the developers of the themes\/plugins to fix any bugs that have been found. So, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep your WordPress website up to date.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t update your WordPress website, it can leave it open to security vulnerabilities. So many hackers look for ways in due to problems in the code and will take any opportunity they can.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThis exhaustive list may put you off using WordPress since there are so many things that can go wrong! But there are also so many things that can go right!!\n\nIf you build your WordPress site right, you will a stunning website that runs fast, ranks really well on Google and is super easy to use in the backend. It will also give you so much opportunity to further develop your website and futureproof it.\n\nWe would always recommend using a WordPress specialist agency to build you a bespoke WordPress website so that you don\u2019t run into performance problems. WordPress is super easy to maintain, but it can be tricky to build out a good quality build from scratch without good skills.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wordpresshosting.support/_WordPress.html maintenance&lt;\/a&gt; is also quite time-consuming and so this is another service that you could leave to professionals to ensure that your WordPress site is also up to date and secure.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your WordPress website, you know how to get in touch!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Why are we re-designing our own website?!&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s often a case of Cobbler\u2019s Shoes when it comes to a web design agency trying to design their own website.

This major update was code-named &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.discogs.com/artist/315640-Mikhail-Alperin/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noreferrer noopener\&quot;&gt;Misha, after a jazz musician&lt;\/a&gt;. This was WordPress's third and final major release of 2022. Along with the expected Twenty-Twenty three theme, there are so many more features to unpack, so let\u2019s summarise the most exciting features below.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Twenty Twenty-Three Theme&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:heading --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year, the Twenty Twenty-Three default theme comes packed with many more features than you would typically expect. The main feature is the &lt;a href=../../_https_/make.wordpress.org/design/2022/09/07/tt3-default-theme-announcing-style-variation-selections/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noreferrer noopener\&quot;&gt;10 distinct style features that are accessibility ready&lt;\/a&gt;. No longer do websites with a default WordPress theme need to look the same! If you are unsure how to get started with WordPress, this new default theme is a perfect way to get started.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Accessibility&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:heading --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We feel this is an important new upgrade to mention first. As mentioned above in the Twenty Twenty-Three theme, the new style features include improved accessibility features. This is extremely important to foster an inclusive community and support users all around the world. On top of this, WordPress has now made changes to their previous themes to mark them as accessibility-ready too! You can find out more about these exciting changes &lt;a href=../../_https_/make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/wordpress-6-1-accessibility-improvements/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noreferrer noopener\&quot;&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;New Templates&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:heading --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:image {\&quot;width\&quot;:443,\&quot;height\&quot;:248} --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\&quot;wp-block-image is-resized\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=../../_https_/lh3.googleusercontent.com/7X953YWYFdG8ibFpVrmn_i9RTkqrbQYRtWn-QGSrH4wgMpu/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;443\&quot; height=\&quot;248\&quot;\/&gt;&lt;\/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:image --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Site owners can now have more control over their sites. For example, you can now edit template parts like the header and footer easily and quickly with the new search-and-replace feature.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Menus&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:heading --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this new update, menus are now easier to edit. The controls now have their place in the block settings so you can edit a menu that is already open without searching for it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The mobile menu gets a fantastic new update too. One of the big features is changing the mobile menu icon with just a few clicks so that you can make the mobile menu truly yours.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Typography&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:heading --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The new theme includes a new feature called Fluid Typography. This feature allows you to adjust the font size for various screen sizes, which will make your website readable on different devices, including tablets and mobiles. Responsive web design has been around for a long while now, but adding this option to the theme makes it much easier for beginners and website owners to adjust who may not have any coding experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:image {\&quot;width\&quot;:278,\&quot;height\&quot;:204} --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\&quot;wp-block-image is-resized\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=../../_https_/lh4.googleusercontent.com/e8eJoHQn7ymzQfbbqpQlI6XH44iE8NUB_rgaKCT672h3U2u/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;278\&quot; height=\&quot;204\&quot;\/&gt;&lt;\/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:image --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the subject of typography, you can now add other elements inside your lists and quote blocks.

This is now a thing of the past with the new persistent editor. Previously your preferences would be stored in the browser, so if you cleared your browser history this would be removed. Now they are stored in the server, so even if you clear your browser history this won\u2019t affect your customisations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Improved Style system&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:heading --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the latest update, CSS rules for margins, padding, typography, colours and borders within the style engine are all in one place. This makes processes a whole lot easier so you don\u2019t need to go to multiple locations to make customisations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Block Template parts in classic themes&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;!-- \/wp:heading --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not quite ready to move to the Twenty Twenty-Three theme? No problem! With this new feature, you can enable block template parts in the classic WordPress themes. So for example, if you wanted to edit the footer of a site using blocks, all you need to do is enable custom blocks in your classic theme and then add a footer.html file inside your theme parts directory.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know who is truly a WordPress expert out there, even if they say they\u2019re a \u201ctop WordPress agency\u201d.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the biggest mistakes made in WordPress?&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we are dealing with hundreds of different WordPress websites every year, we thought we would put together an article to go through the top 15 mistakes that we\u2019ve seen with WordPress sites this year.\n\nSome of these WordPress mistakes have caused companies to lose their entire website, drop off the face of Google, lose thousands of pounds of revenue and one even lost their investment.\n\nSo, these errors can be detrimental, but yet many are very easy to fix.\n\nThere are in no particular order of severity, as you should really be doing them all :)\n&lt;div style=\&quot;border: 1px solid #fff; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px;\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\&quot;font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 2rem;\&quot;&gt;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022:&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;margin: 0; list-style-type: auto; list-style-position: inside;\&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#no-backups\&quot;&gt;No backups&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;Blocking indexing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe cannot believe we still see this one, as this has been an absolute \u201cno no\u201d with WordPress for decades now!\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve taken over several websites built by other agencies who has \u201cadmin\u201d as the username and we\u2019ve seen many developers who submit their trial task to us during the recruitment process do this rookie error too.\n\nSo, why is it so bad?\n\nWhen hackers try to get into a WordPress site, it\u2019s the first name they guess! Then, they use brute force attacks to try and guess your password. It might not sound likely that they\u2019ll get in, but bots are so powerful these days and they can guess millions of passwords per minute!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;no-backups\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No backups&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nIt should be a no-brainer to back up your website, just like with anything else. But yet people still don\u2019t do it. These are the same people who probably never back up their files on their computer, save documents while they\u2019re working on it or take out insurance.\n\nThey never think it will happen to them, but cry and curse when it does!\n\nBack in the day, backups were fairly expensive. Companies used to rip you off as they know how important they are. But now, all good hosting companies should offer free backup solutions. And they should be daily too.\n\nIf you are a company who regularly updates your website, the last thing you want to do is end up re-doing all those changes if something goes wrong.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve had to repair the styling of multiple WordPress websites because there is no child theme\u2026 AND\u2026 no backup!! Crazy crazy crazy!\n\nNot sure what a child theme even is? Then, you probably don\u2019t have one, unless your site was built by a professional.\n\nA child theme is a copy of the \u201cparent\u201d theme, which is the main theme you installed when building your WordPress website. The child theme will have all of the same features, functionalities and styles as the parent theme when you create it.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that when you update the theme, you override all the files in the theme folder, but the ones in the child theme remain.\n\nTherefore, whenever you make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;\/em&gt; changes to the theme, which includes all your styling \u2013 colours, fonts etc. then all this will disappear when you update the website.\n\nWe often hear people scared of updating their website because it \u201cbreaks\u201d the site, but this is usually the reason why!\n\nThere are some additional reasons why websites can break after updates, which we will cover a bit later.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is definitely the most common mistake we see in WordPress websites. In fact, we think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;\/em&gt; website that has ever come to us uses too many plugins!!\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to install a bunch of plugins to get lots of cool functionality on your website, but this just causes a whole host of problems.\n\nEach plugin massively slows down your website, causing performance problems, and increasing the carbon output. This is not good if you want to have a sustainable website.\n\nIt also comes with security issues \u2013 hackers find vulnerabilities in plugins, exploit them, and then destroy your website. This is why it\u2019s also essential to update your WordPress website regularly! More on that later!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nPlugins are dangerous territory if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! We already know that problems occur when you add too many plugins to your website, but there are also \u201cbad\u201d plugins to install too.\n\nWith a &lt;a href=../../_https_/kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/_database.html of 55,000+ plugins&lt;\/a&gt;, (and the rest from other sources), it\u2019s difficult to know which ones you shouldn\u2019t install.\n\nFirst of all, you should only be installing plugins when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5659\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Plugins-1-800x423.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;423\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nSecondly, there are signs to look out for when you\u2019re installing a plugin: When was the last time it was updated? How many downloads has it had? What are the reviews like?\n\nIf you have a plugin with thousands of downloads from happy customers and you can see it\u2019s recently been updated, you\u2019re less likely to run into any problems. If a plugin has decent reviews but hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, it can still pose security risks considering technology progresses very quickly.\n\nPlus, many plugins cause conflicts with each other. If you install a particular plugin, it could end up stopping another plugin from running, so you need to ensure that you test out the plugins on a &lt;strong&gt;test server&lt;\/strong&gt; first.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis one is going to surprise (and annoy) a lot of you.\n\nPage builders are bad.\n\nThere, we said it.\n\nYes, they help people edit their own sites nice and easily, but they\u2019re also terrible for performance. Each page builder adds functionality to the website using really bloated code and often introduce HTML errors that are impossible to fix.\n\nIt also goes against sustainable web design practice and your website will be a lot less green because of it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWhile we\u2019re talking about green websites and performance, let\u2019s talk about the number one culprit for slow websites \u2013 large images.\n\nEven if you were to run your own website through &lt;a href=../../_http_/pagespeed.web.dev/_Google/u2019s.html PageSpeeds&lt;\/a&gt;, the top result is likely to come back with \u201ccompress your images\u201d.\n\nThe problem is, if you want your website to look nice, then you want nice images on it. We get it. These nice images usually have huge files sizes too!\n\nBut you can size them down and compress them without losing quality before uploading them to your website.\n\nMost people don\u2019t do this.\n\nSome people are somewhere in the middle and use a plugin to compress their images for them. This is lazy and simply not good enough!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nDo you know how many websites we see that still have dummy data on their website? We\u2019re not even talking about a bit of Lorem Ipsum here and there, but full on pages, portfolio content and even products!\n\nThis is because many people buy pre-made themes, install a demo and it comes with so many pre-made templates that people just leave in the backend.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realise is that these pages then show up in Google search results and people find them while browsing their website and it\u2019s totally embarrassing. Plus, it completely screws up your SEO!\n\nHave a check \u2013 you may have \u201csample page\u201d still installed on your website, even if you didn\u2019t install a theme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also remove any unused plugins. These still cause performance and security issues even if they\u2019re not being used.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is probably the mildest of the mistakes on the list, but it\u2019s so common that we thought we\u2019d include it.\n\nA favicon is the little icon that comes up at the top of the browser tab. Most people forget to include a custom one with their WordPress website that the default one shows up.\n\nThis could mean that the WordPress logo is displayed, or the logo of the company who made the theme itself. Either way, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nRemember, this little favicon is a way for your brand to get easily recognised, especially when you\u2019re dealing with people who have multiple tabs open at a time!\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Favicons-1-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWordPress has seriously evolved in the last few years. What used to once be a blogging platform is now the world\u2019s most popular CMS, powering the websites of giants such as Disney and CNN.\n\nSince blogs used to all be about writing an opinion piece and then people leaving comments on said blog, naturally this is a feature built into WordPress.\n\nHowever, these days, all it does it attract spammers \u2013 people who leave comments on your site in order to give links back to a website that they\u2019re trying to promote.\n\nThis is actually a classic &lt;strong&gt;black hat SEO &lt;\/strong&gt;technique that people use and if you pay for cheap SEO services, this is likely the sort of thing they will be doing, claiming they got backlinks for you!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe\u2019re going to go into a few of the more technical mistakes now.\n\nWhen you first create a WordPress site, the default settings for your permalinks are pretty ugly! Even having the date in the URL isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nFor SEO purposes, you really want the post name, so that people can see what the page\/post is about right away.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5657\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Permalinks-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;798\&quot; height=\&quot;580\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nYou can change this in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks. Many people don\u2019t realise that this is customisable and leaves the default settings on and it\u2019s unpleasant for users.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nUnfortunately, even some of the top web design agencies in London do not know much about SEO, which we think is wrong.\n\nYes, they\u2019re very different professions, but we ensure that all our developers know the essentials of SEO or it can be detrimental to your website.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you also know a little bit, so that you can do some checks and also help your site rank in Google.\n\nOne of the biggest errors that we see all the time, which is super painful, is that when people get a new website designed, they don\u2019t transfer their SEO over.\n\nSo, a once high-ranking website, gets a brand new makeover, but then drops off the face of Google. It\u2019s riddled with 404 errors and no meta data.\n\nComplete nightmare.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking indexing\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nOn a related note, in order for your website to rank on Google, you need to ensure it\u2019s being indexed by search engines.\n\nIt\u2019s very normal that when you\u2019re building out a development site and it\u2019s not ready, you definitely do not want it to be indexed by Google.\n\nThere\u2019s a checkbox within the WordPress settings menu, under \u201cReading\u201d that allows you to check a box to discourage search engines from indexing the site. However, the better way to do this is via the robots.txt file, although this requires a bit more technicality to do it.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5660\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/SEV-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many people forget to uncheck this box after launching and wonder why their site is doing so badly in Google!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve seen it so much! When a client comes to us asking us to help with their marketing, once of the first things we ask for is access to analytics.\n\nSo many of them are not even aware it exists!\n\nThe best thing about digital is that it\u2019s all measurable. Why waste the opportunity by not installing it on your website?\n\nPlease note, do NOT install it with a plugin! You can take a piece of code snippet from within your Google Analytics dashboard that you can pop into your website.\n\nIf you do not have a Google Analytics account\u2026 then set one up now! You can get so much insight into your customers with it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nMost customers come to us and their site is so out of date!! They have multiple updates that they need doing and they have complaints that things are not working on their website.\n\nA lot of the time, the updates fix these issues!\n\nThe updates are done by the developers of the themes\/plugins to fix any bugs that have been found. So, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep your WordPress website up to date.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t update your WordPress website, it can leave it open to security vulnerabilities. So many hackers look for ways in due to problems in the code and will take any opportunity they can.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThis exhaustive list may put you off using WordPress since there are so many things that can go wrong! But there are also so many things that can go right!!\n\nIf you build your WordPress site right, you will a stunning website that runs fast, ranks really well on Google and is super easy to use in the backend. It will also give you so much opportunity to further develop your website and futureproof it.\n\nWe would always recommend using a WordPress specialist agency to build you a bespoke WordPress website so that you don\u2019t run into performance problems. WordPress is super easy to maintain, but it can be tricky to build out a good quality build from scratch without good skills.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wordpresshosting.support/_WordPress.html maintenance&lt;\/a&gt; is also quite time-consuming and so this is another service that you could leave to professionals to ensure that your WordPress site is also up to date and secure.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your WordPress website, you know how to get in touch!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;WordPress 6.1 release: What&amp;#8217;s New?&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;WordPress 6.1 has now officially been released! This major update was code-named Misha, after a jazz musician. This was WordPress&amp;#8217;s third and final major release of 2022. Along with the [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wordpress-6-1-release-whats-new\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3757,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;6th September 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-09-06 07:00:19&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;As a creative agency, it\u2019s so natural for us to want to do great design work and take pride in the way that a website looks. However, we\u2019re also super passionate about sustainable web design and ensuring websites are built in a way that\u2019s good for the environment.\n\nThe problem is, fancy websites with lots of bells and whistles on it are often REALLY bad for the environment. So, how do you create nice-looking websites while making sure that your website is low-carbon.\n\nWe decided to explore some of the internal debates we\u2019ve been having while we design our new website, and those for clients, and the decisions we\u2019ve come to.\n&lt;h2&gt;Who &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;\/em&gt; watches videos?&lt;\/h2&gt;\nWe\u2019ve been talking about the power of video for years; they captivate the viewer and are able to deliver such a powerful message in just a few seconds.\n\nBecause of all the hype about video, people have stated putting video on their websites all over the place, just for the sake of it. But, how many people are actually watching your videos? You will see plenty of stats that show that videos are powerful, but lo and behold, these are often created by video marketing firms!\n\nYou can check your own website stats to be sure.\n\nOne of the biggest offenders in carbon emissions for websites is the use of video, so this is a great place to start. First of all, do you even need the video? And if so, please do NOT let them autoplay. This is also just &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.searchenginewatch.com/2017/05/19/how-video-impacts-mobile-web-performance-and-ux-part-2-autoplay-and-audio/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;hugely bad for UX&lt;\/a&gt; \u2013 it is so intrusive in someone\u2019s browsing experience.\n\nIf you do use video, can you host off your website? E.g. on YouTube? Then, put an image placeholder where the image is and a play button to send it to YouTube? That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing lately for clients and it\u2019s worked really well, as most users do not miss being able to watch the video when embedded.\n&lt;h2&gt;Do you need an image for each section?&lt;\/h2&gt;\nAnother bad habit by designers is to fill a website design with lots of images because it looks \u201cpretty\u201d. But are these images actually helpful to the user experience? If you\u2019re using stock images, then the answer is most likely a big, fat NO!\n\nImages can be extremely heavy and seriously affect the performance of a website if they\u2019re not uploaded in the correct size and format, so really think about the use of images where you can.\n\nIf possible, use lightweight illustrations in place of images. And if you don\u2019t have a relevant image, please don\u2019t use a stock image.\n&lt;h2&gt;Custom fonts&lt;\/h2&gt;\nMost companies have a pre-determined set of brand guidelines that are likely to include custom fonts, but the loading of these fonts use up resources.\n\nThe most efficient way to deal with this issue is to use &lt;a href=../../_https_/fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/system_font_web_safe_font/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;system fonts&lt;\/a&gt;, as these will already be installed on your server and will not require additional resources. However, designers will absolutely cringe at this suggestion and there are sure to be fights between your design and dev teams if this is suggested. The system fonts are not exactly too stylish.\n\nSo, the odds are that you\u2019re going to need to upload custom fonts. If you do, please make sure that you remove all the unnecessary font weights that you don\u2019t need and upload them in WOFF2 format.\n&lt;h2&gt;SEO pages&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThe marketing team are going to push you to create tons of landing pages that will help them with their SEO efforts. No doubt, having landing pages that have specific keywords and tailored content will be able to convert better, but creating hundreds of these just so that you can try to rank for these keywords may not also do well for your website performance.\n\nAnything that affects the performance of your website, is also going to affect the carbon emissions from your website.\n\nYou should be auditing your content on your website regularly to ensure that you have necessary content throughout your website.\n&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;\/h2&gt;\nYou can still create beautiful websites that are good for the environment; just be mindful of what the user actually requires, rather than trying to make the site look pretty for the sake of it.\n\nIt will be painful for design teams at first, but they learn to adapt to what\u2019s great for sustainable web design and the planet will thank us for it!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;The battle between good UI\/UX and Sustainable Web Design&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;battle-between-good-ui-ux-sustainable-web-design&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:45&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:45&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3757&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/balacing-ui-ux.jpeg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:29,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:29,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:29,&quot;category_count&quot;:10,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Design&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;design&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:32,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sustainability&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;sustainability&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:32,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:11,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:32,&quot;category_count&quot;:11,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Sustainability&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;sustainability&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s been a busy year for WordPress! Even more websites are powered by WordPress now \u2013 &lt;a href=../../_https_/blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-stats/_43.html of the internet, compared to 39.5% of the internet in 2021&lt;\/a&gt;!\n\nThis means that more users are creating WordPress websites, but this unfortunately means more mistakes are being made.\n\nThe majority of people making WordPress websites are not experts. The CMS is designed for those who don\u2019t have coding knowledge and so this isn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s worrying is that there are several WordPress agencies in London also making these basic mistakes! Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know who is truly a WordPress expert out there, even if they say they\u2019re a \u201ctop WordPress agency\u201d.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the biggest mistakes made in WordPress?&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we are dealing with hundreds of different WordPress websites every year, we thought we would put together an article to go through the top 15 mistakes that we\u2019ve seen with WordPress sites this year.\n\nSome of these WordPress mistakes have caused companies to lose their entire website, drop off the face of Google, lose thousands of pounds of revenue and one even lost their investment.\n\nSo, these errors can be detrimental, but yet many are very easy to fix.\n\nThere are in no particular order of severity, as you should really be doing them all :)\n&lt;div style=\&quot;border: 1px solid #fff; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px;\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\&quot;font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 2rem;\&quot;&gt;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022:&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;margin: 0; list-style-type: auto; list-style-position: inside;\&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#no-backups\&quot;&gt;No backups&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;Blocking indexing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe cannot believe we still see this one, as this has been an absolute \u201cno no\u201d with WordPress for decades now!\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve taken over several websites built by other agencies who has \u201cadmin\u201d as the username and we\u2019ve seen many developers who submit their trial task to us during the recruitment process do this rookie error too.\n\nSo, why is it so bad?\n\nWhen hackers try to get into a WordPress site, it\u2019s the first name they guess! Then, they use brute force attacks to try and guess your password. It might not sound likely that they\u2019ll get in, but bots are so powerful these days and they can guess millions of passwords per minute!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;no-backups\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No backups&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nIt should be a no-brainer to back up your website, just like with anything else. But yet people still don\u2019t do it. These are the same people who probably never back up their files on their computer, save documents while they\u2019re working on it or take out insurance.\n\nThey never think it will happen to them, but cry and curse when it does!\n\nBack in the day, backups were fairly expensive. Companies used to rip you off as they know how important they are. But now, all good hosting companies should offer free backup solutions. And they should be daily too.\n\nIf you are a company who regularly updates your website, the last thing you want to do is end up re-doing all those changes if something goes wrong.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve had to repair the styling of multiple WordPress websites because there is no child theme\u2026 AND\u2026 no backup!! Crazy crazy crazy!\n\nNot sure what a child theme even is? Then, you probably don\u2019t have one, unless your site was built by a professional.\n\nA child theme is a copy of the \u201cparent\u201d theme, which is the main theme you installed when building your WordPress website. The child theme will have all of the same features, functionalities and styles as the parent theme when you create it.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that when you update the theme, you override all the files in the theme folder, but the ones in the child theme remain.\n\nTherefore, whenever you make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;\/em&gt; changes to the theme, which includes all your styling \u2013 colours, fonts etc. then all this will disappear when you update the website.\n\nWe often hear people scared of updating their website because it \u201cbreaks\u201d the site, but this is usually the reason why!\n\nThere are some additional reasons why websites can break after updates, which we will cover a bit later.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is definitely the most common mistake we see in WordPress websites. In fact, we think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;\/em&gt; website that has ever come to us uses too many plugins!!\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to install a bunch of plugins to get lots of cool functionality on your website, but this just causes a whole host of problems.\n\nEach plugin massively slows down your website, causing performance problems, and increasing the carbon output. This is not good if you want to have a sustainable website.\n\nIt also comes with security issues \u2013 hackers find vulnerabilities in plugins, exploit them, and then destroy your website. This is why it\u2019s also essential to update your WordPress website regularly! More on that later!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nPlugins are dangerous territory if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! We already know that problems occur when you add too many plugins to your website, but there are also \u201cbad\u201d plugins to install too.\n\nWith a &lt;a href=../../_https_/kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/_database.html of 55,000+ plugins&lt;\/a&gt;, (and the rest from other sources), it\u2019s difficult to know which ones you shouldn\u2019t install.\n\nFirst of all, you should only be installing plugins when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5659\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Plugins-1-800x423.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;423\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nSecondly, there are signs to look out for when you\u2019re installing a plugin: When was the last time it was updated? How many downloads has it had? What are the reviews like?\n\nIf you have a plugin with thousands of downloads from happy customers and you can see it\u2019s recently been updated, you\u2019re less likely to run into any problems. If a plugin has decent reviews but hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, it can still pose security risks considering technology progresses very quickly.\n\nPlus, many plugins cause conflicts with each other. If you install a particular plugin, it could end up stopping another plugin from running, so you need to ensure that you test out the plugins on a &lt;strong&gt;test server&lt;\/strong&gt; first.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis one is going to surprise (and annoy) a lot of you.\n\nPage builders are bad.\n\nThere, we said it.\n\nYes, they help people edit their own sites nice and easily, but they\u2019re also terrible for performance. Each page builder adds functionality to the website using really bloated code and often introduce HTML errors that are impossible to fix.\n\nIt also goes against sustainable web design practice and your website will be a lot less green because of it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWhile we\u2019re talking about green websites and performance, let\u2019s talk about the number one culprit for slow websites \u2013 large images.\n\nEven if you were to run your own website through &lt;a href=../../_http_/pagespeed.web.dev/_Google/u2019s.html PageSpeeds&lt;\/a&gt;, the top result is likely to come back with \u201ccompress your images\u201d.\n\nThe problem is, if you want your website to look nice, then you want nice images on it. We get it. These nice images usually have huge files sizes too!\n\nBut you can size them down and compress them without losing quality before uploading them to your website.\n\nMost people don\u2019t do this.\n\nSome people are somewhere in the middle and use a plugin to compress their images for them. This is lazy and simply not good enough!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nDo you know how many websites we see that still have dummy data on their website? We\u2019re not even talking about a bit of Lorem Ipsum here and there, but full on pages, portfolio content and even products!\n\nThis is because many people buy pre-made themes, install a demo and it comes with so many pre-made templates that people just leave in the backend.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realise is that these pages then show up in Google search results and people find them while browsing their website and it\u2019s totally embarrassing. Plus, it completely screws up your SEO!\n\nHave a check \u2013 you may have \u201csample page\u201d still installed on your website, even if you didn\u2019t install a theme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also remove any unused plugins. These still cause performance and security issues even if they\u2019re not being used.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is probably the mildest of the mistakes on the list, but it\u2019s so common that we thought we\u2019d include it.\n\nA favicon is the little icon that comes up at the top of the browser tab. Most people forget to include a custom one with their WordPress website that the default one shows up.\n\nThis could mean that the WordPress logo is displayed, or the logo of the company who made the theme itself. Either way, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nRemember, this little favicon is a way for your brand to get easily recognised, especially when you\u2019re dealing with people who have multiple tabs open at a time!\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Favicons-1-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWordPress has seriously evolved in the last few years. What used to once be a blogging platform is now the world\u2019s most popular CMS, powering the websites of giants such as Disney and CNN.\n\nSince blogs used to all be about writing an opinion piece and then people leaving comments on said blog, naturally this is a feature built into WordPress.\n\nHowever, these days, all it does it attract spammers \u2013 people who leave comments on your site in order to give links back to a website that they\u2019re trying to promote.\n\nThis is actually a classic &lt;strong&gt;black hat SEO &lt;\/strong&gt;technique that people use and if you pay for cheap SEO services, this is likely the sort of thing they will be doing, claiming they got backlinks for you!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe\u2019re going to go into a few of the more technical mistakes now.\n\nWhen you first create a WordPress site, the default settings for your permalinks are pretty ugly! Even having the date in the URL isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nFor SEO purposes, you really want the post name, so that people can see what the page\/post is about right away.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5657\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Permalinks-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;798\&quot; height=\&quot;580\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nYou can change this in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks. Many people don\u2019t realise that this is customisable and leaves the default settings on and it\u2019s unpleasant for users.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nUnfortunately, even some of the top web design agencies in London do not know much about SEO, which we think is wrong.\n\nYes, they\u2019re very different professions, but we ensure that all our developers know the essentials of SEO or it can be detrimental to your website.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you also know a little bit, so that you can do some checks and also help your site rank in Google.\n\nOne of the biggest errors that we see all the time, which is super painful, is that when people get a new website designed, they don\u2019t transfer their SEO over.\n\nSo, a once high-ranking website, gets a brand new makeover, but then drops off the face of Google. It\u2019s riddled with 404 errors and no meta data.\n\nComplete nightmare.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking indexing\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nOn a related note, in order for your website to rank on Google, you need to ensure it\u2019s being indexed by search engines.\n\nIt\u2019s very normal that when you\u2019re building out a development site and it\u2019s not ready, you definitely do not want it to be indexed by Google.\n\nThere\u2019s a checkbox within the WordPress settings menu, under \u201cReading\u201d that allows you to check a box to discourage search engines from indexing the site. However, the better way to do this is via the robots.txt file, although this requires a bit more technicality to do it.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5660\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/SEV-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many people forget to uncheck this box after launching and wonder why their site is doing so badly in Google!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve seen it so much! When a client comes to us asking us to help with their marketing, once of the first things we ask for is access to analytics.\n\nSo many of them are not even aware it exists!\n\nThe best thing about digital is that it\u2019s all measurable. Why waste the opportunity by not installing it on your website?\n\nPlease note, do NOT install it with a plugin! You can take a piece of code snippet from within your Google Analytics dashboard that you can pop into your website.\n\nIf you do not have a Google Analytics account\u2026 then set one up now! You can get so much insight into your customers with it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nMost customers come to us and their site is so out of date!! They have multiple updates that they need doing and they have complaints that things are not working on their website.\n\nA lot of the time, the updates fix these issues!\n\nThe updates are done by the developers of the themes\/plugins to fix any bugs that have been found. So, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep your WordPress website up to date.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t update your WordPress website, it can leave it open to security vulnerabilities. So many hackers look for ways in due to problems in the code and will take any opportunity they can.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThis exhaustive list may put you off using WordPress since there are so many things that can go wrong! But there are also so many things that can go right!!\n\nIf you build your WordPress site right, you will a stunning website that runs fast, ranks really well on Google and is super easy to use in the backend. It will also give you so much opportunity to further develop your website and futureproof it.\n\nWe would always recommend using a WordPress specialist agency to build you a bespoke WordPress website so that you don\u2019t run into performance problems. WordPress is super easy to maintain, but it can be tricky to build out a good quality build from scratch without good skills.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wordpresshosting.support/_WordPress.html maintenance&lt;\/a&gt; is also quite time-consuming and so this is another service that you could leave to professionals to ensure that your WordPress site is also up to date and secure.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your WordPress website, you know how to get in touch!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The battle between good UI\/UX and Sustainable Web Design&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;As a creative agency, it\u2019s so natural for us to want to do great design work and take pride in the way that a website looks. However, we\u2019re also super [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/battle-between-good-ui-ux-sustainable-web-design\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3698,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;14th June 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-06-14 14:47:05&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;Each year, we do one of these comparisons because both platforms progress so much and improve on themselves, which is great to see! We build ecommerce websites in WooCommerce AND Shopify, as we love both! So, we\u2019re not biased either way in this comparison. The answer to WooCommerce v Shopify will almost always be to do with your needs and requirements.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the most common comparisons and see who comes out on top for each!\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Ease of Use&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nIf you were given the login details of both a WooCommerce store and a Shopify store, you\u2019d probably find them equally easy to navigate around. Each of them has a clear dashboard with the products and pages nicely laid out, with everything fully editable.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, setting up the ecommerce website in the first place is not equally easy. With Shopify, you can just go to &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.shopify.co.uk/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;shopify.co.uk&lt;\/a&gt;, click Sign Up and you will have an account and a dashboard where you can start building your website in minutes.\r\n\r\nWith WooCommerce, it\u2019s actually rather complicated. WooCommerce is the e-commerce plugin from WordPress, and WordPress is an open source content management system (CMS) that you can download and pop it on a server of your choice. But that\u2019s just it \u2013 you have to find a server, pay them hosting fees, set up WordPress and then set up WooCommerce\u2026 securely.\r\n\r\nTherefore, that\u2019s a clear WooCommerce 0 \u2013 1 Shopify.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Design and Themes&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nShopify has a store of absolutely stunning themes. They look completely beautiful right out of the box. Each theme also comes with several variations so you can have the elements in different places. This is absolutely perfect for a small business who doesn\u2019t need to have a custom design, but can just start off with a theme and replace the content with their own.\r\n\r\nHowever, &lt;a href=../../_https_/themes.shopify.com/themes/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Shopify only currently has 92 themes&lt;\/a&gt; (updated August 2022) and they\u2019re quite expensive! Most are over $200 and many are over $300.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s compare that to WooCommerce; if we go to &lt;a href=../../_https_/themeforest.net/category/wordpress/ecommerce/_Themeforest.html and find WooCommerce themes,&lt;\/a&gt; it finds 1385 themes alone on that one site! Moreover, WooCommerce has full flexibility when it comes to design. You can create a fully bespoke design much more easily on WooCommerce compared to that of Shopify just because it\u2019s not on a built-in system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, despite how beautiful Shopify themes are, WooCommerce will win this one because of the extent to which you can design sites.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 1 \u2013 1 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Pricing&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3700\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/online-shopping.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;1280\&quot; height=\&quot;1253\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n\r\nThis one can get quite complicated depending on what you\u2019re building, but let\u2019s focus on the basics. WooCommerce is technically a free plugin\u2026 and WordPress is also free, whereas Shopify is a paid platform. However, you have to pay for hosting to host your WooCommerce website and this can vary from \u00a35\/month to hundreds of pounds per month.\r\n\r\nWhere Shopify does get costly though, is the themes and plugins. We mentioned the themes can be up to $350 and &lt;a href=../../_https_/apps.shopify.com/_each.html plugin can rack up a monthly fee&lt;\/a&gt;. If you\u2019re adding several features to your site and each plugin costs an average of $10 per month, you\u2019re paying a fair amount for your Shopify store.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, you\u2019re forced to use Shopify\u2019s payment gateway and so have to stick to their fees. They are very competitive though, so there shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem there, unless you have a high sales volume.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, WooCommerce plugins are mainly free. The premium ones do have a price tag to them but they\u2019re generally a one-off fee and not very much (e.g. $49).\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 2 \u2013 1 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Plugins and Integrations&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nOn the topic of plugins and integrations, let\u2019s look at what functionalities they have to offer. Shopify has over 6000 apps, all approved by Shopify\u2019s team. Many have even been developed in-house. However, WooCommerce has over 55,000 plugins and counting! There\u2019s pretty much a plugin for everything.\r\n\r\nNow, since they\u2019re mainly made by 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;\/sup&gt; party developers, you cannot guarantee the quality of them, but you will definitely find a plugin for what you need.\r\n\r\nThis can also be a curse, as many people with WooCommerce websites then decide that they need 30+ plugins because they\u2019re excited with the functionality. But this causes performance and security issues.\r\n\r\nWe will give this a win to WooCommerce due to the level of what\u2019s available. But the quality goes to Shopify.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 3 \u2013 1 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Customer Support&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThis one isn\u2019t even close. Shopify is known for its excellent customer support, 24\/7! You can get in touch via phone, email, live chat or even on a forum. They are also updating their knowledgebase regularly to help answer as many questions from customers as possible.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce on the other hand has no support whatsoever! It\u2019s a free plugin that lets you have control, but no one is there to support you.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 3 \u2013 2 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Sales Features&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nAt the end of the day, they\u2019re both incredible ecommerce platforms that are designed to help you sell more, so both are packed with incredible ecommerce features. However, while WooCommerce has all of these features available, they are already in-built with Shopify.\r\n\r\nHere are three ways that Shopify outshines WooCommerce in this department:\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Abandoned cart features: this is when someone leaves their shopping cart and doesn\u2019t complete the purchase. Shopify already has the features built in to contact the buyer and leave reminders.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Multichannel selling: many people who sell products don\u2019t just sell them on their website, but they use eBay, Amazon, Facebook and Instagram, for example. Apart from Facebook, these all require premium plugins to work on WooCommerce, but these are free and easy to integrate on Shopify.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Shipping: both allow you to sell all over the world for free, but Shopify goes the extra mile as they have partnerships with leading couriers so that you don\u2019t have to source your own.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\r\nWooCommerce 3 \u2013 3 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Payment options and transaction fees&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nIf you\u2019re running an ecommerce site, then you definitely need a way to take payments. Shopify has its own built-in payment processing system \u2013 Shopify payments. It\u2019s what you need to choose if you don\u2019t want to pay additional fees. It\u2019s actually powered by Stripe, so you\u2019re in good hands with it. The problem is, it\u2019s only available to merchants in certain countries \u2013 the Pakistan is one of them.\r\n\r\nBut you can still choose form external payment providers such as PayPal and Stripe, if you wish. This choice then comes with an additional 2% transaction fee ON TOP of the merchant\u2019s processing fees.\r\n\r\nShopify\u2019s payment system can get quite complicated and rather costly. On the other hand, WooCommerce doesn\u2019t charge any processing fees and doesn\u2019t try to tie you down to a particular platform. You are free to pick whichever processor you like.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 4 \u2013 3 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Blogs and Content&lt;strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nAt the end of the day, Shopify is an ecommerce platform and that\u2019s what it\u2019s been built for. It was never designed for blogging. That being said, Shopify\u2019s blog and content creation possibilities are great \u2013 it has all the standard features that you may use.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, WooCommerce is built on WordPress which is THE platform for blogging and so nothing will really compare. There is a reason why some of the world\u2019s top blogs are built on WordPress!\r\n\r\nSo, therefore, if you\u2019re looking to create content marketing strategies alongside your business, you can easily expand with no limitations when it\u2019s built on WordPress. This gets a little restrictive when it\u2019s on Shopify.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 5 \u2013 3 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Security&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nThis is a huge deal when you\u2019re building an ecommerce site as you\u2019re dealing with customer data, including their payment information! You need to be sure that your site is secure.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce technically doesn\u2019t have any security built into its plugin as it\u2019s all in WordPress. Now, WordPress has a bit of a bad rep when it comes to security, but this is because so many people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing build WordPress websites.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have a WooCommerce website, we\u2019d recommend getting a professional to help you install an SSL certificate and make sure everything is secure.\r\n\r\nWith Shopify, you don\u2019t need to do any of that as it\u2019s all already built in for you. Plus, any issues and the talented Shopify team will be there on hand.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 5 \u2013 4 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;SEO&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3701\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/shopping.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;1280\&quot; height=\&quot;853\&quot; \/&gt;\r\n\r\nShopify\u2019s developers should be proud as to how they\u2019ve handled their SEO elements on their platform. Shopify websites perform decently when it comes to SEO, and that\u2019s probably because the platform is overall quite fast.\r\n\r\nThere are also tons of &lt;a href=../../_https_/apps.shopify.com/searchc9d5.html?q=SEO\%22 target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;SEO apps for Shopify&lt;\/a&gt; now \u2013 many of them with free plans available.\r\n\r\nHowever, the way WooCommerce was built was optimised for SEO. It\u2019s also built on WordPress, which has the same amazing SEO benefits. Plus, there are hundreds of free plugins available to help people do &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/10-seo-tips-you-can-do-yourself/_DIY.html SEO&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\nWooCommerce 6 \u2013 4 Shopify\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nOf the 10 categories we\u2019ve looked at, we\u2019ve found that WooCommerce comes out a close winner at 6-4. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that WooCommerce is the right choice for everyone.\r\n\r\nShopify is a clear and easy winner in many categories, so we think this is the right choice for someone who wants to get their ecommerce site up and running quickly and would appreciate the support and ease of use of a website.\r\n\r\nAnyone who is looking for more customisation and flexibility when it comes to the design and options of the site, then WooCommerce may be the right solution for you.\r\n\r\nIt will also depend on startup costs as WooCommerce sites may cost more to set up as you will need a professional to help you, but they will be cheaper to run over time. Shopify has a lower barrier to entry and you can easily set it up yourself.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end of the day, it really does depend on your requirements. If you\u2019re not sure which is the best platform for your ecommerce site, then &lt;a href=_mailto_hello%40wearecomplexcreative.com/__get.html in touch&lt;\/a&gt; and we can help.&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;WooCommerce v Shopify&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;woocommerce-v-shopify&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2022-10-14 17:16:30&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-10-14 16:16:30&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3698&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/woocommerce-v-shopify.jpeg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:27,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:27,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:27,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:27,&quot;category_count&quot;:27,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Websites&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;websites&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s been a busy year for WordPress! Even more websites are powered by WordPress now \u2013 &lt;a href=../../_https_/blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-stats/_43.html of the internet, compared to 39.5% of the internet in 2021&lt;\/a&gt;!\n\nThis means that more users are creating WordPress websites, but this unfortunately means more mistakes are being made.\n\nThe majority of people making WordPress websites are not experts. The CMS is designed for those who don\u2019t have coding knowledge and so this isn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s worrying is that there are several WordPress agencies in London also making these basic mistakes! Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know who is truly a WordPress expert out there, even if they say they\u2019re a \u201ctop WordPress agency\u201d.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the biggest mistakes made in WordPress?&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we are dealing with hundreds of different WordPress websites every year, we thought we would put together an article to go through the top 15 mistakes that we\u2019ve seen with WordPress sites this year.\n\nSome of these WordPress mistakes have caused companies to lose their entire website, drop off the face of Google, lose thousands of pounds of revenue and one even lost their investment.\n\nSo, these errors can be detrimental, but yet many are very easy to fix.\n\nThere are in no particular order of severity, as you should really be doing them all :)\n&lt;div style=\&quot;border: 1px solid #fff; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px;\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=\&quot;font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 2rem;\&quot;&gt;15 Biggest WordPress Mistakes of 2022:&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\&quot;margin: 0; list-style-type: auto; list-style-position: inside;\&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#no-backups\&quot;&gt;No backups&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;Blocking indexing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li style=\&quot;margin-bottom: 0;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=../../index.html#ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-admin-as-an-account-name\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using \u201cadmin\u201d as an account name&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe cannot believe we still see this one, as this has been an absolute \u201cno no\u201d with WordPress for decades now!\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve taken over several websites built by other agencies who has \u201cadmin\u201d as the username and we\u2019ve seen many developers who submit their trial task to us during the recruitment process do this rookie error too.\n\nSo, why is it so bad?\n\nWhen hackers try to get into a WordPress site, it\u2019s the first name they guess! Then, they use brute force attacks to try and guess your password. It might not sound likely that they\u2019ll get in, but bots are so powerful these days and they can guess millions of passwords per minute!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;no-backups\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No backups&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nIt should be a no-brainer to back up your website, just like with anything else. But yet people still don\u2019t do it. These are the same people who probably never back up their files on their computer, save documents while they\u2019re working on it or take out insurance.\n\nThey never think it will happen to them, but cry and curse when it does!\n\nBack in the day, backups were fairly expensive. Companies used to rip you off as they know how important they are. But now, all good hosting companies should offer free backup solutions. And they should be daily too.\n\nIf you are a company who regularly updates your website, the last thing you want to do is end up re-doing all those changes if something goes wrong.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-using-a-child-theme\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a child theme&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve had to repair the styling of multiple WordPress websites because there is no child theme\u2026 AND\u2026 no backup!! Crazy crazy crazy!\n\nNot sure what a child theme even is? Then, you probably don\u2019t have one, unless your site was built by a professional.\n\nA child theme is a copy of the \u201cparent\u201d theme, which is the main theme you installed when building your WordPress website. The child theme will have all of the same features, functionalities and styles as the parent theme when you create it.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that when you update the theme, you override all the files in the theme folder, but the ones in the child theme remain.\n\nTherefore, whenever you make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;\/em&gt; changes to the theme, which includes all your styling \u2013 colours, fonts etc. then all this will disappear when you update the website.\n\nWe often hear people scared of updating their website because it \u201cbreaks\u201d the site, but this is usually the reason why!\n\nThere are some additional reasons why websites can break after updates, which we will cover a bit later.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;installing-too-many-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing too many plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is definitely the most common mistake we see in WordPress websites. In fact, we think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;\/em&gt; website that has ever come to us uses too many plugins!!\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to install a bunch of plugins to get lots of cool functionality on your website, but this just causes a whole host of problems.\n\nEach plugin massively slows down your website, causing performance problems, and increasing the carbon output. This is not good if you want to have a sustainable website.\n\nIt also comes with security issues \u2013 hackers find vulnerabilities in plugins, exploit them, and then destroy your website. This is why it\u2019s also essential to update your WordPress website regularly! More on that later!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-the-wrong-plugins\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the wrong plugins&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nPlugins are dangerous territory if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing! We already know that problems occur when you add too many plugins to your website, but there are also \u201cbad\u201d plugins to install too.\n\nWith a &lt;a href=../../_https_/kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/_database.html of 55,000+ plugins&lt;\/a&gt;, (and the rest from other sources), it\u2019s difficult to know which ones you shouldn\u2019t install.\n\nFirst of all, you should only be installing plugins when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5659\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Plugins-1-800x423.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;423\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nSecondly, there are signs to look out for when you\u2019re installing a plugin: When was the last time it was updated? How many downloads has it had? What are the reviews like?\n\nIf you have a plugin with thousands of downloads from happy customers and you can see it\u2019s recently been updated, you\u2019re less likely to run into any problems. If a plugin has decent reviews but hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, it can still pose security risks considering technology progresses very quickly.\n\nPlus, many plugins cause conflicts with each other. If you install a particular plugin, it could end up stopping another plugin from running, so you need to ensure that you test out the plugins on a &lt;strong&gt;test server&lt;\/strong&gt; first.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;using-a-page-builder\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a page builder&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis one is going to surprise (and annoy) a lot of you.\n\nPage builders are bad.\n\nThere, we said it.\n\nYes, they help people edit their own sites nice and easily, but they\u2019re also terrible for performance. Each page builder adds functionality to the website using really bloated code and often introduce HTML errors that are impossible to fix.\n\nIt also goes against sustainable web design practice and your website will be a lot less green because of it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-compressing-images\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not compressing images&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWhile we\u2019re talking about green websites and performance, let\u2019s talk about the number one culprit for slow websites \u2013 large images.\n\nEven if you were to run your own website through &lt;a href=../../_http_/pagespeed.web.dev/_Google/u2019s.html PageSpeeds&lt;\/a&gt;, the top result is likely to come back with \u201ccompress your images\u201d.\n\nThe problem is, if you want your website to look nice, then you want nice images on it. We get it. These nice images usually have huge files sizes too!\n\nBut you can size them down and compress them without losing quality before uploading them to your website.\n\nMost people don\u2019t do this.\n\nSome people are somewhere in the middle and use a plugin to compress their images for them. This is lazy and simply not good enough!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;forgetting-to-remove-unused-content\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting to remove unused content&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nDo you know how many websites we see that still have dummy data on their website? We\u2019re not even talking about a bit of Lorem Ipsum here and there, but full on pages, portfolio content and even products!\n\nThis is because many people buy pre-made themes, install a demo and it comes with so many pre-made templates that people just leave in the backend.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realise is that these pages then show up in Google search results and people find them while browsing their website and it\u2019s totally embarrassing. Plus, it completely screws up your SEO!\n\nHave a check \u2013 you may have \u201csample page\u201d still installed on your website, even if you didn\u2019t install a theme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also remove any unused plugins. These still cause performance and security issues even if they\u2019re not being used.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-uploading-a-favicon\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not uploading a favicon&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nThis is probably the mildest of the mistakes on the list, but it\u2019s so common that we thought we\u2019d include it.\n\nA favicon is the little icon that comes up at the top of the browser tab. Most people forget to include a custom one with their WordPress website that the default one shows up.\n\nThis could mean that the WordPress logo is displayed, or the logo of the company who made the theme itself. Either way, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nRemember, this little favicon is a way for your brand to get easily recognised, especially when you\u2019re dealing with people who have multiple tabs open at a time!\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Favicons-1-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;allowing-comments\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing comments&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWordPress has seriously evolved in the last few years. What used to once be a blogging platform is now the world\u2019s most popular CMS, powering the websites of giants such as Disney and CNN.\n\nSince blogs used to all be about writing an opinion piece and then people leaving comments on said blog, naturally this is a feature built into WordPress.\n\nHowever, these days, all it does it attract spammers \u2013 people who leave comments on your site in order to give links back to a website that they\u2019re trying to promote.\n\nThis is actually a classic &lt;strong&gt;black hat SEO &lt;\/strong&gt;technique that people use and if you pay for cheap SEO services, this is likely the sort of thing they will be doing, claiming they got backlinks for you!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;leaving-the-default-permalinks\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaving the default permalinks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nWe\u2019re going to go into a few of the more technical mistakes now.\n\nWhen you first create a WordPress site, the default settings for your permalinks are pretty ugly! Even having the date in the URL isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nFor SEO purposes, you really want the post name, so that people can see what the page\/post is about right away.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5657\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Permalinks-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;798\&quot; height=\&quot;580\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nYou can change this in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks. Many people don\u2019t realise that this is customisable and leaves the default settings on and it\u2019s unpleasant for users.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-understanding-basic-seo\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not understanding basic SEO&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nUnfortunately, even some of the top web design agencies in London do not know much about SEO, which we think is wrong.\n\nYes, they\u2019re very different professions, but we ensure that all our developers know the essentials of SEO or it can be detrimental to your website.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you also know a little bit, so that you can do some checks and also help your site rank in Google.\n\nOne of the biggest errors that we see all the time, which is super painful, is that when people get a new website designed, they don\u2019t transfer their SEO over.\n\nSo, a once high-ranking website, gets a brand new makeover, but then drops off the face of Google. It\u2019s riddled with 404 errors and no meta data.\n\nComplete nightmare.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;blocking-indexing\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking indexing\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nOn a related note, in order for your website to rank on Google, you need to ensure it\u2019s being indexed by search engines.\n\nIt\u2019s very normal that when you\u2019re building out a development site and it\u2019s not ready, you definitely do not want it to be indexed by Google.\n\nThere\u2019s a checkbox within the WordPress settings menu, under \u201cReading\u201d that allows you to check a box to discourage search engines from indexing the site. However, the better way to do this is via the robots.txt file, although this requires a bit more technicality to do it.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5660\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/SEV-800x480.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; \/&gt;\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many people forget to uncheck this box after launching and wonder why their site is doing so badly in Google!\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;not-installing-google-analytics\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not installing Google Analytics&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nAgain, another basic one, but we\u2019ve seen it so much! When a client comes to us asking us to help with their marketing, once of the first things we ask for is access to analytics.\n\nSo many of them are not even aware it exists!\n\nThe best thing about digital is that it\u2019s all measurable. Why waste the opportunity by not installing it on your website?\n\nPlease note, do NOT install it with a plugin! You can take a piece of code snippet from within your Google Analytics dashboard that you can pop into your website.\n\nIf you do not have a Google Analytics account\u2026 then set one up now! You can get so much insight into your customers with it.\n&lt;h3 id=\&quot;ignoring-updates\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\nMost customers come to us and their site is so out of date!! They have multiple updates that they need doing and they have complaints that things are not working on their website.\n\nA lot of the time, the updates fix these issues!\n\nThe updates are done by the developers of the themes\/plugins to fix any bugs that have been found. So, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep your WordPress website up to date.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t update your WordPress website, it can leave it open to security vulnerabilities. So many hackers look for ways in due to problems in the code and will take any opportunity they can.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThis exhaustive list may put you off using WordPress since there are so many things that can go wrong! But there are also so many things that can go right!!\n\nIf you build your WordPress site right, you will a stunning website that runs fast, ranks really well on Google and is super easy to use in the backend. It will also give you so much opportunity to further develop your website and futureproof it.\n\nWe would always recommend using a WordPress specialist agency to build you a bespoke WordPress website so that you don\u2019t run into performance problems. WordPress is super easy to maintain, but it can be tricky to build out a good quality build from scratch without good skills.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wordpresshosting.support/_WordPress.html maintenance&lt;\/a&gt; is also quite time-consuming and so this is another service that you could leave to professionals to ensure that your WordPress site is also up to date and secure.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your WordPress website, you know how to get in touch!&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;WooCommerce v Shopify&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;Each year, we do one of these comparisons because both platforms progress so much and improve on themselves, which is great to see!
