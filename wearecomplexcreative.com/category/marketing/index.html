The pandemic naturally shifted the world a lot more digital, but people\u2019s concerns and values have really changed now and marketers have to adapt their strategy to perform.\n\nAs one of the top marketing agencies in London, we are under constant pressure to get results for our clients and stay on top of trends.\n\nWe\u2019ve been doing some digging into what\u2019s been getting the best results for clients and put together this guide of our top 10 marketing trends that we think we will see lots more of in 2023.\n\nThey\u2019re in no particular order\u2026\n\n&lt;u&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWe felt we had to start with this one! With so much talk at the moment about Chat GPT, we thought we\u2019d dig right into this subject immediately.\n\nFirst of all, we can assure you that this article is not written by AI :)\n\nWhilst we find it fascinating, we do not agree with content that\u2019s written by machines, as they don\u2019t &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;\/em&gt; understand our audience yet. Plus, it doesn\u2019t really go with our \u201cNo BS\u201d tagline!\n\nBut machines are getting smarter and smarter, and the quality of content they\u2019re spitting out is scarily good.\n\nOur director, Sabrina Chevannes, even suggested that &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H1009.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22>Chat GPT could possibly replace some employees!&lt;\/a&gt; We haven\u2019t done that yet, but it is a scary suggestion.\n\nWhile we think that AI tools aren\u2019t good enough to create full copy, they are brilliant at generating ideas! So, if you\u2019re trying to come up with a content plan, then why not ask it for some blog post suggestions? How about some keyword research for your website so you know what to target.\n\nAI can do all of these things, as well as even write you a whole month of social media content in 2 mins! You may want to tweak some of these and put them in your own tone of voice, but wow\u2026 AI is really going to be a game-changer for marketers.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H/indexe842.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22 target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone wp-image-5528 size-full\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;522\&quot; height=\&quot;653\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;User-generated content and influencers&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nInfluencer marketing isn\u2019t a new marketing trend, but it is one that\u2019s still going strong. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2022/08/23/the-creator-economy-is-booming-heres-how-businesses-can-tap-into-its-potential/index23cc.html?sh=127d5e933d27\%22>The creator economy is booming&lt;\/a&gt; and more and more people want to become a content creator and embrace their entrepreneurial side.\n\nPeople care more about \u201creal\u201d footage and brands who are not lying to their customers. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.frontify.com/en/blog/the-age-of-authenticity-why-brands-need-to-get-real/_90%25.html of consumers say they would rather buy from authentic brands&lt;\/a&gt; and so picking the right influencer is also hugely important.\n\nBrands are shying away from using big celebrity endorsements as consumers are aware of the paid affiliation and paying less attention to these ads. This is why we think that &lt;strong&gt;nano-influencers&lt;\/strong&gt; are likely to be more popular in 2023.\n\nNano-influencers are accounts with 5-10k followers, but they have a much more loyal following, who believe what they have to say and are more likely to be authentic. &lt;a href=../../_https_/yougov.co.uk/topics/resources/articles-reports/2022/03/18/62-social-media-users-trust-influencers-more-celeb/_62%25.html of social media users said they trust influencers over celebrities.&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Responsibility&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nJust how consumers care more about authenticity now, they also care about social responsibility.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/consumer-trends/harris-poll-82-of-consumers-want-a-brands-values-to-align-with-their-own/_recent.html Harris Poll&lt;\/a&gt; showed that 82% of customers will pick brands that align with their values, which means that brands also need to be showing more of who they are and what they believe in online.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/bcorporation.uk/reinventing-business/by-b-lab-uk/celebrating-5-000-b-corps/_now.html over 5000 B Corps&lt;\/a&gt; and still a long waiting list, which shows that companies are trying to do more than just make a profit.\n\nCompanies who show they are genuinely interested in sustainability, DEI and giving back, will more likely do well in 2023. But the key word here is &lt;strong&gt;genuinely&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 if you get caught faking it, it\u2019s worse than doing nothing about it.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Hyper-personalisation&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThe world has moved on from Hey [first-name] in emails! There\u2019s so much more now when it comes to personalisation.\n\nYou\u2019re probably already freaked out that you could be talking about something one moment and then the next, you see if on your Facebook\/Instagram feed.Yup \u2013 everyone is listening\u2026 in one way or another.\n\nMarketing is going to get hyper-personalised, thanks to the use of AI and there are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thedrum.com/opinion/2022/09/22/hyper-personalization-here-how-can-brands-use-it-boost-retail-results/_so.html many ways that brands can use it to their advantage&lt;\/a&gt;.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail/_recent.html report from McKinsey&lt;\/a&gt; stated that consumers are 80% more likely to buy from brands if their shopping experience is personalised.\n\nThis makes complete sense as we are always talking about making sure you\u2019re talking &lt;strong&gt;directly to your customer&lt;\/strong&gt;.\n\nNow, with the use of all this modern tech, there are ways you can do just that, and tailor their experience to their personal likes, wants and needs.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Commerce&lt;\/u&gt;\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5529\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-2-800x534.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;534\&quot;&gt;\n\nAgain, social commerce is not a new trend, but it is rising again! As the world has gotten so used to shopping online, most brands now have a decent digital presence.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/_Social.html media use is still increasing&lt;\/a&gt; too, so brands are looking for how to increase the user experience (UX), by allowing their customers to check out directly from their social media posts.\n\nThis goes perfectly in hand with the UGC element we mentioned, as then influencers can directly tag products and make for a seamless shopping experience.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Virtual Events&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWhile the world has come back to a more normal feel after the pandemic, people\u2019s priorities have shifted. Many value spending quality time at home a lot more and are not attending events as frequently.\n\nIn-person events are definitely an amazing experience for many, but they also require a huge budget, a lot of resources and can be very stressful to run.\n\nYou can reach an international audience a lot more quickly and cheaper when running virtual events.\n\nNow that COVID made the likes of Zoom and webinars feel a bit more \u201cnormal\u201d, it\u2019s a great time to embrace all your options to expand your reach and network by running more virtual events and streaming live.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Use of Video&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nIt feels like we put this in our trends every year, but it just keeps on increasing in popularity!\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why we\u2019ve seen a huge popularity in TikTok and YouTube over the last couple of years.\n\nBut every social media channel has really started to &lt;a href=../../_https_/guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent603f.html?sessionId=3_cc-session_04f6ffd4-00fb-4279-a2dc-c2ee00d8d8f6&amp;amp;lang=en-US\%22>shift towards promoting video&lt;\/a&gt; and so there\u2019s even more pressure to produce good video content.\n\nThis has caused some of our clients a bit of anxiety as they don\u2019t feel they have the budget to produce quality videos, but luckily consumers like the \u201craw\u201d video feel where you get to genuinely see what a brand is like.\n\nThis can be done easily on a smartphone and minimal video editing is required. Plus, with the native features within TikTok and Reels, there\u2019s so much potential.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5527\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/graph-800x506.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;506\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: center;\&quot;&gt;Caption: Source = Statista. January 2022&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;u&gt;AR\/VR&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAugmented reality and virtual reality have been spoken about a lot over the last few years and big things have been predicted from them, but not too much has come to light.\n\nThis is probably because the technology is so complicated and is largely quite expensive to implement. So, many brands just can\u2019t afford to get involved.\n\nFor example, the Metaverse is something that has been spoken about a great deal over the last couple of years, but we haven\u2019t really seen the need to get our clients to invest in it as there just isn\u2019t the audience there.\n\nBut &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/ikea-space-unfolded-pop-up-provides-shoppers-with-ar-powered-design-experience/_brands.html like IKEA&lt;\/a&gt; have shown that using AR\/VR to create immersive experiences for their customers can be hugely beneficial.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.adroll.com/blog/augmented-and-virtual-reality-in-marketing/_cost-effective.html ways of integrating AR\/VR into your marketing campaigns&lt;\/a&gt;, and we expect to see a lot more of these in 2023.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Storytelling&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nStorytelling has been a staple of marketing since the dawn of time, so it's no surprise that this trend is still going strong. But what does storytelling mean in the context of 2023? In many ways, it's about taking a step back from traditional approaches and breaking out with new ideas to engage customers.\n\nStorytelling doesn't have to involve fiction\u2014it can also be used as an effective way to communicate product benefits or ideas in your company culture. While we're all familiar with fictional stories such as books or movies, storytelling isn't inherently limited to those mediums; you can use the same techniques in your social media content or blog posts for example.\n\nAs long as you're telling stories that resonate with your audience, they'll be more likely to pay attention than if you just spew out facts without context or meaning behind them (not that there's anything wrong with facts). This can even help customers who aren't usually interested in learning more about your company learn something new by connecting them emotionally through their personal experiences rather than just spouting off stats and figures.\n\nThink about the rise in personal branding at the moment \u2013 you will see plenty of people \u201cteaching\u201d storytelling now so that individuals can build up a personal brand and really connect with their audience.\n\nBrands can also do this, and connect with their audience on a more emotional level.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Privacy&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAs consumers become more aware of the value of their personal data, it's likely that data privacy will continue to be a key concern for businesses in the coming years.\n\nThis means that businesses will need to be transparent about how they collect, use, and protect customer data, and will need to ensure that they are in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. By prioritising data privacy, businesses can build trust with their customers and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/future-of-marketing/privacy-and-trust/research-customer-expectations-ads-privacy/_Google.html even did some research&lt;\/a&gt; into how their ads performed and those brands who respected data performed much better with their ads.\n\nSo, these are our predictions for marketing trends in 2023, but the world of marketing is so unpredictable at times, so let\u2019s see how many we get right!\n\nWe will see you back here in a year where we review them :)&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;10 marketing trends you can expect to see in 2023&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;10-marketing-trends-you-can-expect-to-see-in-2023&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:00:41&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:00:41&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=5526&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/top-10-marketing-1-780x520.webp&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:26,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:26,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:24,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:26,&quot;category_count&quot;:24,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We feel like the world of marketing has completely changed over the last couple of years! The pandemic naturally shifted the world a lot more digital, but people\u2019s concerns and values have really changed now and marketers have to adapt their strategy to perform.\n\nAs one of the top marketing agencies in London, we are under constant pressure to get results for our clients and stay on top of trends.\n\nWe\u2019ve been doing some digging into what\u2019s been getting the best results for clients and put together this guide of our top 10 marketing trends that we think we will see lots more of in 2023.\n\nThey\u2019re in no particular order\u2026\n\n&lt;u&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWe felt we had to start with this one! With so much talk at the moment about Chat GPT, we thought we\u2019d dig right into this subject immediately.\n\nFirst of all, we can assure you that this article is not written by AI :)\n\nWhilst we find it fascinating, we do not agree with content that\u2019s written by machines, as they don\u2019t &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;\/em&gt; understand our audience yet. Plus, it doesn\u2019t really go with our \u201cNo BS\u201d tagline!\n\nBut machines are getting smarter and smarter, and the quality of content they\u2019re spitting out is scarily good.\n\nOur director, Sabrina Chevannes, even suggested that &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H1009.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22>Chat GPT could possibly replace some employees!&lt;\/a&gt; We haven\u2019t done that yet, but it is a scary suggestion.\n\nWhile we think that AI tools aren\u2019t good enough to create full copy, they are brilliant at generating ideas! So, if you\u2019re trying to come up with a content plan, then why not ask it for some blog post suggestions? How about some keyword research for your website so you know what to target.\n\nAI can do all of these things, as well as even write you a whole month of social media content in 2 mins! You may want to tweak some of these and put them in your own tone of voice, but wow\u2026 AI is really going to be a game-changer for marketers.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H/indexe842.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22 target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone wp-image-5528 size-full\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;522\&quot; height=\&quot;653\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;User-generated content and influencers&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nInfluencer marketing isn\u2019t a new marketing trend, but it is one that\u2019s still going strong. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2022/08/23/the-creator-economy-is-booming-heres-how-businesses-can-tap-into-its-potential/index23cc.html?sh=127d5e933d27\%22>The creator economy is booming&lt;\/a&gt; and more and more people want to become a content creator and embrace their entrepreneurial side.\n\nPeople care more about \u201creal\u201d footage and brands who are not lying to their customers. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.frontify.com/en/blog/the-age-of-authenticity-why-brands-need-to-get-real/_90%25.html of consumers say they would rather buy from authentic brands&lt;\/a&gt; and so picking the right influencer is also hugely important.\n\nBrands are shying away from using big celebrity endorsements as consumers are aware of the paid affiliation and paying less attention to these ads. This is why we think that &lt;strong&gt;nano-influencers&lt;\/strong&gt; are likely to be more popular in 2023.\n\nNano-influencers are accounts with 5-10k followers, but they have a much more loyal following, who believe what they have to say and are more likely to be authentic. &lt;a href=../../_https_/yougov.co.uk/topics/resources/articles-reports/2022/03/18/62-social-media-users-trust-influencers-more-celeb/_62%25.html of social media users said they trust influencers over celebrities.&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Responsibility&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nJust how consumers care more about authenticity now, they also care about social responsibility.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/consumer-trends/harris-poll-82-of-consumers-want-a-brands-values-to-align-with-their-own/_recent.html Harris Poll&lt;\/a&gt; showed that 82% of customers will pick brands that align with their values, which means that brands also need to be showing more of who they are and what they believe in online.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/bcorporation.uk/reinventing-business/by-b-lab-uk/celebrating-5-000-b-corps/_now.html over 5000 B Corps&lt;\/a&gt; and still a long waiting list, which shows that companies are trying to do more than just make a profit.\n\nCompanies who show they are genuinely interested in sustainability, DEI and giving back, will more likely do well in 2023. But the key word here is &lt;strong&gt;genuinely&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 if you get caught faking it, it\u2019s worse than doing nothing about it.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Hyper-personalisation&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThe world has moved on from Hey [first-name] in emails! There\u2019s so much more now when it comes to personalisation.\n\nYou\u2019re probably already freaked out that you could be talking about something one moment and then the next, you see if on your Facebook\/Instagram feed.Yup \u2013 everyone is listening\u2026 in one way or another.\n\nMarketing is going to get hyper-personalised, thanks to the use of AI and there are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thedrum.com/opinion/2022/09/22/hyper-personalization-here-how-can-brands-use-it-boost-retail-results/_so.html many ways that brands can use it to their advantage&lt;\/a&gt;.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail/_recent.html report from McKinsey&lt;\/a&gt; stated that consumers are 80% more likely to buy from brands if their shopping experience is personalised.\n\nThis makes complete sense as we are always talking about making sure you\u2019re talking &lt;strong&gt;directly to your customer&lt;\/strong&gt;.\n\nNow, with the use of all this modern tech, there are ways you can do just that, and tailor their experience to their personal likes, wants and needs.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Commerce&lt;\/u&gt;\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5529\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-2-800x534.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;534\&quot;&gt;\n\nAgain, social commerce is not a new trend, but it is rising again! As the world has gotten so used to shopping online, most brands now have a decent digital presence.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/_Social.html media use is still increasing&lt;\/a&gt; too, so brands are looking for how to increase the user experience (UX), by allowing their customers to check out directly from their social media posts.\n\nThis goes perfectly in hand with the UGC element we mentioned, as then influencers can directly tag products and make for a seamless shopping experience.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Virtual Events&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWhile the world has come back to a more normal feel after the pandemic, people\u2019s priorities have shifted. Many value spending quality time at home a lot more and are not attending events as frequently.\n\nIn-person events are definitely an amazing experience for many, but they also require a huge budget, a lot of resources and can be very stressful to run.\n\nYou can reach an international audience a lot more quickly and cheaper when running virtual events.\n\nNow that COVID made the likes of Zoom and webinars feel a bit more \u201cnormal\u201d, it\u2019s a great time to embrace all your options to expand your reach and network by running more virtual events and streaming live.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Use of Video&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nIt feels like we put this in our trends every year, but it just keeps on increasing in popularity!\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why we\u2019ve seen a huge popularity in TikTok and YouTube over the last couple of years.\n\nBut every social media channel has really started to &lt;a href=../../_https_/guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent603f.html?sessionId=3_cc-session_04f6ffd4-00fb-4279-a2dc-c2ee00d8d8f6&amp;amp;lang=en-US\%22>shift towards promoting video&lt;\/a&gt; and so there\u2019s even more pressure to produce good video content.\n\nThis has caused some of our clients a bit of anxiety as they don\u2019t feel they have the budget to produce quality videos, but luckily consumers like the \u201craw\u201d video feel where you get to genuinely see what a brand is like.\n\nThis can be done easily on a smartphone and minimal video editing is required. Plus, with the native features within TikTok and Reels, there\u2019s so much potential.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5527\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/graph-800x506.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;506\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: center;\&quot;&gt;Caption: Source = Statista. January 2022&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;u&gt;AR\/VR&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAugmented reality and virtual reality have been spoken about a lot over the last few years and big things have been predicted from them, but not too much has come to light.\n\nThis is probably because the technology is so complicated and is largely quite expensive to implement. So, many brands just can\u2019t afford to get involved.\n\nFor example, the Metaverse is something that has been spoken about a great deal over the last couple of years, but we haven\u2019t really seen the need to get our clients to invest in it as there just isn\u2019t the audience there.\n\nBut &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/ikea-space-unfolded-pop-up-provides-shoppers-with-ar-powered-design-experience/_brands.html like IKEA&lt;\/a&gt; have shown that using AR\/VR to create immersive experiences for their customers can be hugely beneficial.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.adroll.com/blog/augmented-and-virtual-reality-in-marketing/_cost-effective.html ways of integrating AR\/VR into your marketing campaigns&lt;\/a&gt;, and we expect to see a lot more of these in 2023.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Storytelling&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nStorytelling has been a staple of marketing since the dawn of time, so it's no surprise that this trend is still going strong. But what does storytelling mean in the context of 2023? In many ways, it's about taking a step back from traditional approaches and breaking out with new ideas to engage customers.\n\nStorytelling doesn't have to involve fiction\u2014it can also be used as an effective way to communicate product benefits or ideas in your company culture. While we're all familiar with fictional stories such as books or movies, storytelling isn't inherently limited to those mediums; you can use the same techniques in your social media content or blog posts for example.\n\nAs long as you're telling stories that resonate with your audience, they'll be more likely to pay attention than if you just spew out facts without context or meaning behind them (not that there's anything wrong with facts). This can even help customers who aren't usually interested in learning more about your company learn something new by connecting them emotionally through their personal experiences rather than just spouting off stats and figures.\n\nThink about the rise in personal branding at the moment \u2013 you will see plenty of people \u201cteaching\u201d storytelling now so that individuals can build up a personal brand and really connect with their audience.\n\nBrands can also do this, and connect with their audience on a more emotional level.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Privacy&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAs consumers become more aware of the value of their personal data, it's likely that data privacy will continue to be a key concern for businesses in the coming years.\n\nThis means that businesses will need to be transparent about how they collect, use, and protect customer data, and will need to ensure that they are in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. By prioritising data privacy, businesses can build trust with their customers and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/future-of-marketing/privacy-and-trust/research-customer-expectations-ads-privacy/_Google.html even did some research&lt;\/a&gt; into how their ads performed and those brands who respected data performed much better with their ads.\n\nSo, these are our predictions for marketing trends in 2023, but the world of marketing is so unpredictable at times, so let\u2019s see how many we get right!\n\nWe will see you back here in a year where we review them :)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;10 marketing trends you can expect to see in 2023&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;We feel like the world of marketing has completely changed over the last couple of years!

With energy prices rising, food increasing and shop prices skyrocketing, this has led to the &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.ft.com/content/2fb6f361-a7bb-4b98-8100-6847b5df79b4/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;highest inflation rates in the Pakistan for over 40 years&lt;\/a&gt;, forcing a lot of people to change how they live their lives.\n\nFrom a marketing perspective, marketeers will have to become as flexible and responsive as possible to adapt to consumers\u2019 shifting buying behaviours. This will be the key to helping brands make it through the crisis.\n\nLet's dive into how the crisis will affect the B2C and B2B marketing industry, what consumers' spending habits are like in 2022 going into 2023 and what you can do to survive.\n&lt;h2&gt;Consumer Spending&lt;\/h2&gt;\nPeople are concerned about their personal finances more than ever. This has led to an all time low when it comes to consumer confidence. The overall state of the economy is being reflected in how customers are now thinking about their money, how to spend it and where they can cut back, leading to a &lt;a href=../../_https_/tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/consumer-confidence/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Consumer Confidence Index score of -44&lt;\/a&gt; which is a record breaking low. On average, the lower the consumer confidence score, the less likely people are going to be spending money on things that are not essential.\n\nIn April, a survey was conducted by &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.google.com/searcheba5.html?q=kMG+asking+consumers+about+their+spending+habits&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsZ1FYzuee6rTOuEVsLHW7cRQttRHA%3A1669898956339&amp;amp;ei=zKKIY7aoFI_vgQbv3rOgCQ&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2vumwutj7AhWPd8AKHW_vDJQQ4dUDCA8&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=kMG+asking+consumers+about+their+spending+habits&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEMgUIABCiBDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwA0oECEEYAEoECEYYAFD9DVjkD2CZEWgCcAF4AIABZ4gByAGSAQMxLjGYAQCgAQHIAQjAAQE&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp\%22 target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;KPMG asking consumers about their spending habits&lt;\/a&gt; for the remainder of the year. Here's what they found.\n\nEssentials\n&lt;ul&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;51% spending less on food and drink shopping&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;31% will spend less on transport&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;18% less on fitness&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;56% are planned to order less takeaways&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;47% will spend less on experiences such as the cinema&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;34% will spend less on beauty products and services&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;26% less on subscriptions&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\nThese results are a clear indicator that consumers are worried about the cost of living and have even cut back on items that are considered essential.\n&lt;h2&gt;Marketing - how will it change?&lt;\/h2&gt;\nThe biggest challenge marketers may face in the coming months is brands cutting their marketing spend and scaling back. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.orchard.co.uk/blog/the-impact-of-the-cost-of-living-crisis-on-the-marketing-sector-24703.aspx/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;85% of Pakistan consumers think that brands should cut their marketing spend&lt;\/a&gt; in hopes of this reducing the cost of products. This can be extremely frustrating, especially moving into the Christmas period, however it's important to have empathy and position ourselves as the consumers too.\n\nWith that being said, there are ways to adjust your strategy to make the best of the uncertain times ahead.\n\n1. Showcase your value\n\nCustomer confidence is at an all time low. So this is the time where you should be confirming and reiterating your brand values and showing consumers why you are a brand they should invest in.\n\n2. Focus on customer loyalty\n\nPeople are more likely to be buying from brands they already know and trust in a bid to not waste money. This is an opportunity to reward loyal customers who will in turn be the consumers that keep your brand alive.\n\n3. Adjust your SEO strategy\n\nIn these times people will be searching for different topics and searching for more essential items. This is the time to look at what keywords may be trending and searched for on all platforms as they may no longer be what you are expecting. Doing this will increase your visibility and traffic to your channels.\n\n4. Focus on organic content and increase your online visibility\n\nOrganic strategies will not require as much of your marketing budget to execute. Not only that but there is a lot of value in growing your brand presence organically. People who engage with your content will have found you organically and if they decide to follow or buy, you truly know they are a loyal follower. The rise of TikTok has really shown us the power organic content can hold.\n&lt;h2&gt;What about B2B marketers?&lt;\/h2&gt;\nWhile private consumers in the Pakistan are protected somewhat with caps on rising bills, businesses do not have the same support system in place. Therefore many businesses are putting measures in place to protect themselves by having hiring freezes and potentially cutting their marketing costs.\n\nNavigating these challenging times may prove itself difficult, but it is doable.\n\n1. Leverage what makes you unique when it comes to presenting yourselves to other businesses.\n\nWhat makes you different, why are you the best investment and fit for the job at hand. Understanding what makes your brand unique will allow other brands to resonate with you.\n\n2. Build your email list\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, customer loyalty is extremely important for the survival of your business. An email list will offer the chance to reach out to old leads, previous clients and re-target one time buyers. A strong CRM system is vital to keeping your business healthy through a recession.\n\n3. Reviews and testimonials.\n\nThe best way to secure business is by giving evidence that you are good at what you do. Showcase that you have happy, satisfied customers and your new potential client can have an amazing and positive experience with you. Let's be honest, whenever you want to invest in anything, I am sure you look at reviews first. Nearly &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/online-review-statistics/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;79% of people say they trust reviews they read online.&lt;\/a&gt; If you haven't got any out there, it's time to start asking for some.\n\nWith that being said, marketing will change exponentially. The impact of the rescission can be fatal for business, but you have to be flexible, resilient and always turn to marketing for a chance of survival.

This is why we think that &lt;strong&gt;nano-influencers&lt;\/strong&gt; are likely to be more popular in 2023.\n\nNano-influencers are accounts with 5-10k followers, but they have a much more loyal following, who believe what they have to say and are more likely to be authentic. &lt;a href=../../_https_/yougov.co.uk/topics/resources/articles-reports/2022/03/18/62-social-media-users-trust-influencers-more-celeb/_62%25.html of social media users said they trust influencers over celebrities.&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Responsibility&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nJust how consumers care more about authenticity now, they also care about social responsibility.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/consumer-trends/harris-poll-82-of-consumers-want-a-brands-values-to-align-with-their-own/_recent.html Harris Poll&lt;\/a&gt; showed that 82% of customers will pick brands that align with their values, which means that brands also need to be showing more of who they are and what they believe in online.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/bcorporation.uk/reinventing-business/by-b-lab-uk/celebrating-5-000-b-corps/_now.html over 5000 B Corps&lt;\/a&gt; and still a long waiting list, which shows that companies are trying to do more than just make a profit.\n\nCompanies who show they are genuinely interested in sustainability, DEI and giving back, will more likely do well in 2023. But the key word here is &lt;strong&gt;genuinely&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 if you get caught faking it, it\u2019s worse than doing nothing about it.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Hyper-personalisation&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThe world has moved on from Hey [first-name] in emails! There\u2019s so much more now when it comes to personalisation.\n\nYou\u2019re probably already freaked out that you could be talking about something one moment and then the next, you see if on your Facebook\/Instagram feed.Yup \u2013 everyone is listening\u2026 in one way or another.\n\nMarketing is going to get hyper-personalised, thanks to the use of AI and there are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thedrum.com/opinion/2022/09/22/hyper-personalization-here-how-can-brands-use-it-boost-retail-results/_so.html many ways that brands can use it to their advantage&lt;\/a&gt;.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail/_recent.html report from McKinsey&lt;\/a&gt; stated that consumers are 80% more likely to buy from brands if their shopping experience is personalised.\n\nThis makes complete sense as we are always talking about making sure you\u2019re talking &lt;strong&gt;directly to your customer&lt;\/strong&gt;.\n\nNow, with the use of all this modern tech, there are ways you can do just that, and tailor their experience to their personal likes, wants and needs.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Commerce&lt;\/u&gt;\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5529\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-2-800x534.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;534\&quot;&gt;\n\nAgain, social commerce is not a new trend, but it is rising again! As the world has gotten so used to shopping online, most brands now have a decent digital presence.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/_Social.html media use is still increasing&lt;\/a&gt; too, so brands are looking for how to increase the user experience (UX), by allowing their customers to check out directly from their social media posts.\n\nThis goes perfectly in hand with the UGC element we mentioned, as then influencers can directly tag products and make for a seamless shopping experience.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Virtual Events&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWhile the world has come back to a more normal feel after the pandemic, people\u2019s priorities have shifted. Many value spending quality time at home a lot more and are not attending events as frequently.\n\nIn-person events are definitely an amazing experience for many, but they also require a huge budget, a lot of resources and can be very stressful to run.\n\nYou can reach an international audience a lot more quickly and cheaper when running virtual events.\n\nNow that COVID made the likes of Zoom and webinars feel a bit more \u201cnormal\u201d, it\u2019s a great time to embrace all your options to expand your reach and network by running more virtual events and streaming live.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Use of Video&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nIt feels like we put this in our trends every year, but it just keeps on increasing in popularity!\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why we\u2019ve seen a huge popularity in TikTok and YouTube over the last couple of years.\n\nBut every social media channel has really started to &lt;a href=../../_https_/guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent603f.html?sessionId=3_cc-session_04f6ffd4-00fb-4279-a2dc-c2ee00d8d8f6&amp;amp;lang=en-US\%22>shift towards promoting video&lt;\/a&gt; and so there\u2019s even more pressure to produce good video content.\n\nThis has caused some of our clients a bit of anxiety as they don\u2019t feel they have the budget to produce quality videos, but luckily consumers like the \u201craw\u201d video feel where you get to genuinely see what a brand is like.\n\nThis can be done easily on a smartphone and minimal video editing is required. Plus, with the native features within TikTok and Reels, there\u2019s so much potential.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5527\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/graph-800x506.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;506\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: center;\&quot;&gt;Caption: Source = Statista. January 2022&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;u&gt;AR\/VR&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAugmented reality and virtual reality have been spoken about a lot over the last few years and big things have been predicted from them, but not too much has come to light.\n\nThis is probably because the technology is so complicated and is largely quite expensive to implement. So, many brands just can\u2019t afford to get involved.\n\nFor example, the Metaverse is something that has been spoken about a great deal over the last couple of years, but we haven\u2019t really seen the need to get our clients to invest in it as there just isn\u2019t the audience there.\n\nBut &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/ikea-space-unfolded-pop-up-provides-shoppers-with-ar-powered-design-experience/_brands.html like IKEA&lt;\/a&gt; have shown that using AR\/VR to create immersive experiences for their customers can be hugely beneficial.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.adroll.com/blog/augmented-and-virtual-reality-in-marketing/_cost-effective.html ways of integrating AR\/VR into your marketing campaigns&lt;\/a&gt;, and we expect to see a lot more of these in 2023.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Storytelling&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nStorytelling has been a staple of marketing since the dawn of time, so it's no surprise that this trend is still going strong. But what does storytelling mean in the context of 2023? In many ways, it's about taking a step back from traditional approaches and breaking out with new ideas to engage customers.\n\nStorytelling doesn't have to involve fiction\u2014it can also be used as an effective way to communicate product benefits or ideas in your company culture. While we're all familiar with fictional stories such as books or movies, storytelling isn't inherently limited to those mediums; you can use the same techniques in your social media content or blog posts for example.\n\nAs long as you're telling stories that resonate with your audience, they'll be more likely to pay attention than if you just spew out facts without context or meaning behind them (not that there's anything wrong with facts). This can even help customers who aren't usually interested in learning more about your company learn something new by connecting them emotionally through their personal experiences rather than just spouting off stats and figures.\n\nThink about the rise in personal branding at the moment \u2013 you will see plenty of people \u201cteaching\u201d storytelling now so that individuals can build up a personal brand and really connect with their audience.\n\nBrands can also do this, and connect with their audience on a more emotional level.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Privacy&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAs consumers become more aware of the value of their personal data, it's likely that data privacy will continue to be a key concern for businesses in the coming years.\n\nThis means that businesses will need to be transparent about how they collect, use, and protect customer data, and will need to ensure that they are in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. By prioritising data privacy, businesses can build trust with their customers and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/future-of-marketing/privacy-and-trust/research-customer-expectations-ads-privacy/_Google.html even did some research&lt;\/a&gt; into how their ads performed and those brands who respected data performed much better with their ads.\n\nSo, these are our predictions for marketing trends in 2023, but the world of marketing is so unpredictable at times, so let\u2019s see how many we get right!\n\nWe will see you back here in a year where we review them :)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;How will marketing change in a recession?&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;The current cost of living crisis is affecting us all, from individuals to business and these sky high inflation prices are set to stick until the second half 2023 before [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/how-will-marketing-change-in-a-recession\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:5374,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;8th November 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-11-08 16:17:52&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;TikTok has quickly become the most downloaded app not only in the Pakistan but in the world&amp;nbsp; having been downloaded over 2 billion times. There are 30.8 million daily users who on average open the app 19 times a day! The big statistic, the app has now been valued at $50 billion.\n\nSo the short answer is, yes your business should be on TikTok.\n\nAlthough these numbers are colossal and we\u2019ve seen creators and businesses blow up reaching over a million followers within a year. It\u2019s never too late to join. Going viral overnight is rare, but doable on TikTok. The exposure and reach opportunities on this platform are very much something that hasn't been seen on any other social platforms before.\n\nMany businesses are now starting to see the value in TikTok and implementing the social app into their marketing strategy. It's also important to note, that you don't need a huge production team, the lights, the cameras and all that jazz to grow a following. The beauty of TikTok is that users value real, relatable content that grabs their attention. You can create content directly in the app and there is a foolproof way to attract followers to your account. Creative content that sparks conversations, gives value or evokes an emotion.\n\nThe algorithm is also built for you to win. Users have their own curated for you pages, where the content will be tailored to their interests and what they are most likely to engage with. It may take a while for the algorithm to find your audience, but don't give up, as long as you are posting imprinting content, you'll find your audience.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be giving you the nudge to join TikTok if we weren't doing it ourselves. We have just joined the app (big woop) and we will be doing a 6 week challenge where we will&amp;nbsp; be taking you behind the scenes of a digital agency, jumping on the trends and showing you our creative side. Check us out over on TikTok.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@complexcreative\/video\/7160721473194462469?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1\n\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Gone are the days when your social media profiles have to be picture perfect and 100% on brand. Going off brand can be extremely beneficial, grab a lot of attention and upsell your services. Let's have a look at some brands that are smashing it on TikTok.&lt;\/span&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ryanair&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;With 1.8 million followers hooked in and invested in the brand, Ryanair have blown up on the app in the last year delivering entertaining content that really does test the limits. Ryanair has ripped up the rule book and it has paid off.&lt;\/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;If you needed a sign to go off brand and get creative with your content, this is it.&lt;\/span&gt;\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@ryanair\/video\/7156991001071062277?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en\n&lt;h2&gt;Gymshark&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;There are brands that still have a mark on tiktok but have not gone too far off brand. Gymshark is a great example of this. Their content is fitness focused and relatable but that they have done is create trending content as it is gaining popularity.&lt;\/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;With the introduction of TikTok shop, ecommerce brands have another opportunity to reach more customers and increase sales directly on the app.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/span&gt;\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@gymshark\/video\/7142558665436859654?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1\n&lt;h2&gt;Later.com&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;There is also an opportunity for serve based brands to grow, Later.com is a perfect example of this. Again they are another brand that is using trending sounds and making it relatable to their content.&lt;\/span&gt;\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@later.com\/video\/7158525544735198469?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en\n\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;If you are looking for an effective way of making some noise about your brand, TikTok is the place to be. Not many platforms can match this app in terms of reach and engagement, so joining the app is a no brainer.&lt;\/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;There is a lot of freedom when it comes to TikTok and with enough perseverance, the right strategy and relatable content you could be on your way to 1 million followers and record breaking sales.&lt;\/span&gt;&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;Should your business be on TikTok?&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;should-your-business-be-on-tiktok&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:12&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:12&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3907&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tiktok-blog-1-780x520-1-780x520.webp&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:26,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:26,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:24,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:26,&quot;category_count&quot;:24,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:31,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Social Media&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;social-media&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:31,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:8,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:31,&quot;category_count&quot;:8,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Social Media&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;social-media&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We feel like the world of marketing has completely changed over the last couple of years!

There\u2019s so much more now when it comes to personalisation.\n\nYou\u2019re probably already freaked out that you could be talking about something one moment and then the next, you see if on your Facebook\/Instagram feed.Yup \u2013 everyone is listening\u2026 in one way or another.\n\nMarketing is going to get hyper-personalised, thanks to the use of AI and there are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thedrum.com/opinion/2022/09/22/hyper-personalization-here-how-can-brands-use-it-boost-retail-results/_so.html many ways that brands can use it to their advantage&lt;\/a&gt;.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail/_recent.html report from McKinsey&lt;\/a&gt; stated that consumers are 80% more likely to buy from brands if their shopping experience is personalised.\n\nThis makes complete sense as we are always talking about making sure you\u2019re talking &lt;strong&gt;directly to your customer&lt;\/strong&gt;.\n\nNow, with the use of all this modern tech, there are ways you can do just that, and tailor their experience to their personal likes, wants and needs.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Commerce&lt;\/u&gt;\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5529\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-2-800x534.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;534\&quot;&gt;\n\nAgain, social commerce is not a new trend, but it is rising again! As the world has gotten so used to shopping online, most brands now have a decent digital presence.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/_Social.html media use is still increasing&lt;\/a&gt; too, so brands are looking for how to increase the user experience (UX), by allowing their customers to check out directly from their social media posts.\n\nThis goes perfectly in hand with the UGC element we mentioned, as then influencers can directly tag products and make for a seamless shopping experience.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Virtual Events&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWhile the world has come back to a more normal feel after the pandemic, people\u2019s priorities have shifted. Many value spending quality time at home a lot more and are not attending events as frequently.\n\nIn-person events are definitely an amazing experience for many, but they also require a huge budget, a lot of resources and can be very stressful to run.\n\nYou can reach an international audience a lot more quickly and cheaper when running virtual events.\n\nNow that COVID made the likes of Zoom and webinars feel a bit more \u201cnormal\u201d, it\u2019s a great time to embrace all your options to expand your reach and network by running more virtual events and streaming live.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Use of Video&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nIt feels like we put this in our trends every year, but it just keeps on increasing in popularity!\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why we\u2019ve seen a huge popularity in TikTok and YouTube over the last couple of years.\n\nBut every social media channel has really started to &lt;a href=../../_https_/guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent603f.html?sessionId=3_cc-session_04f6ffd4-00fb-4279-a2dc-c2ee00d8d8f6&amp;amp;lang=en-US\%22>shift towards promoting video&lt;\/a&gt; and so there\u2019s even more pressure to produce good video content.\n\nThis has caused some of our clients a bit of anxiety as they don\u2019t feel they have the budget to produce quality videos, but luckily consumers like the \u201craw\u201d video feel where you get to genuinely see what a brand is like.\n\nThis can be done easily on a smartphone and minimal video editing is required. Plus, with the native features within TikTok and Reels, there\u2019s so much potential.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5527\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/graph-800x506.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;506\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: center;\&quot;&gt;Caption: Source = Statista. January 2022&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;u&gt;AR\/VR&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAugmented reality and virtual reality have been spoken about a lot over the last few years and big things have been predicted from them, but not too much has come to light.\n\nThis is probably because the technology is so complicated and is largely quite expensive to implement. So, many brands just can\u2019t afford to get involved.\n\nFor example, the Metaverse is something that has been spoken about a great deal over the last couple of years, but we haven\u2019t really seen the need to get our clients to invest in it as there just isn\u2019t the audience there.\n\nBut &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/ikea-space-unfolded-pop-up-provides-shoppers-with-ar-powered-design-experience/_brands.html like IKEA&lt;\/a&gt; have shown that using AR\/VR to create immersive experiences for their customers can be hugely beneficial.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.adroll.com/blog/augmented-and-virtual-reality-in-marketing/_cost-effective.html ways of integrating AR\/VR into your marketing campaigns&lt;\/a&gt;, and we expect to see a lot more of these in 2023.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Storytelling&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nStorytelling has been a staple of marketing since the dawn of time, so it's no surprise that this trend is still going strong. But what does storytelling mean in the context of 2023? In many ways, it's about taking a step back from traditional approaches and breaking out with new ideas to engage customers.\n\nStorytelling doesn't have to involve fiction\u2014it can also be used as an effective way to communicate product benefits or ideas in your company culture. While we're all familiar with fictional stories such as books or movies, storytelling isn't inherently limited to those mediums; you can use the same techniques in your social media content or blog posts for example.\n\nAs long as you're telling stories that resonate with your audience, they'll be more likely to pay attention than if you just spew out facts without context or meaning behind them (not that there's anything wrong with facts). This can even help customers who aren't usually interested in learning more about your company learn something new by connecting them emotionally through their personal experiences rather than just spouting off stats and figures.\n\nThink about the rise in personal branding at the moment \u2013 you will see plenty of people \u201cteaching\u201d storytelling now so that individuals can build up a personal brand and really connect with their audience.\n\nBrands can also do this, and connect with their audience on a more emotional level.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Privacy&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAs consumers become more aware of the value of their personal data, it's likely that data privacy will continue to be a key concern for businesses in the coming years.\n\nThis means that businesses will need to be transparent about how they collect, use, and protect customer data, and will need to ensure that they are in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. By prioritising data privacy, businesses can build trust with their customers and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/future-of-marketing/privacy-and-trust/research-customer-expectations-ads-privacy/_Google.html even did some research&lt;\/a&gt; into how their ads performed and those brands who respected data performed much better with their ads.\n\nSo, these are our predictions for marketing trends in 2023, but the world of marketing is so unpredictable at times, so let\u2019s see how many we get right!\n\nWe will see you back here in a year where we review them :)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Should your business be on TikTok?&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;TikTok has quickly become the most downloaded app not only in the Pakistan but in the world&amp;nbsp; having been downloaded over 2 billion times. There are 30.8 million daily users [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/should-your-business-be-on-tiktok\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:5376,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;25th October 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-10-25 16:06:50&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;Is your business Black Friday ready? Planning in advance will be the key to standing out in a lot of noise over the next few weeks. Although the annual event is called black friday, the fun and games begin long before that.\n\nNot only that but following the &lt;a href=../../_https_/blog.ons.gov.uk/2020/09/18/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-has-accelerated-the-shift-to-online-spending/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;global outbreak, more and more people have now turned to online shopping&lt;\/a&gt;. So making sure your website can handle the traffic should be a top priority.\n\nBut let's get into it. We all know what Black Friday is about and every business is competing to have the best deals, but you know us, we\u2019re known for our honesty and we're going to tell you how it is.&amp;nbsp; The real question is how can you stand out in a sea of offers while also staying true to the core of your brand.\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Leverage social media to be your greatest tool&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSocial media is what is says in the name, social. One thing we will always encourage people to do is to be social on their platforms, that's what they are there for. Find out what your customers want from you, analyse what content they engage with and what content isn't working right now.\n\nIt's always easy to forget that followers are not just a number but they are a customer or a loyal follower of your brand. Leverage this when it comes to your Black Friday deals because those are the people that are routing for your brand. Following you was a conscious choice!\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Don\u2019t bullsh*t Your customers&lt;\/h2&gt;\nWe don't want to name and shame, but there have been many marketing disasters this year that have seen brands being unathletic or jumping on trends that don't relate to them. Don't be that brand. Your customers see right through it.\n\nCustomers know when it's a good deal and when it's not. Equality if Black Friday is not for you, don't force it. Last year we saw &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/the-ordinary-discount-deciem-closing-stores-website-black-friday/320482/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Deciem close all their stores as a stand against Black Friday&lt;\/a&gt; and this year they are doing a month long anti black friday sale. Do what feels right for your brand.\n&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.outboundengine.com/blog/customer-retention-marketing-vs-customer-acquisition-marketing/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Reward customer loyalty&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;Increasing customer retention by 5% can increase profits from 25-95%.&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;The success rate of selling to a customer you already have is 60-70%, while the success rate of selling to a new customer is 5-20%.&lt;\/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li&gt;Research found that existing customers are 50% more likely to try new products and spend 31% more, on average, compared to new customers.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\nDo we need to hit you with any more facts?\n\nYour loyal customers are what is going to spark and sky rocket your growth. Of course we want to acquire new customers, but when it comes to big events remember to nurture the customer you already have and reward loyalty. Offer these customers exclusive VIP deals and discounts to further increase their loyalty and drive repeat sales.\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Utilise other marketing channels&lt;\/h2&gt;\nWe are aware by now that the power in social media is colossal, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn't still value in other marketing channels. If we had to pick one other channel that you should be using it would be email marketing.\n\nThis channel has an &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.litmus.com/resources/email-marketing-roi/_ROI.html of $36 for every $1 spent&lt;\/a&gt;. To put it simply, email is not dead. Not only will this increase your customer retention but it should be helping you make your Black Friday KPIs. Offer discounts and give your subscribers the VIP treatment, make them feel like they're your number 1 priority, which they should be as they are the reason your brand is loved and followed.\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Prepare, prepare, prepare&lt;\/h2&gt;\nYou can never be over prepared but you also never anticipate what is going to happen. Do some careful listening coming up to Black Friday to see what other brands will be doing but also what customers are interested in. Many people prepare their Black Friday shopping lists long before the event.\n\nIf you are anticipating a huge spike in sales or traffic to your website make sure your website is prepared and can handle and increase traffic load.\n\nNot only that but make sure your website looks the part. If you are having&amp;nbsp; Black Friday sale, discount or deal make sure visitors to your site or social media channels are aware of it.\n\nEven if you don't have the capacity to provide customers with the largest discounts and offers, there are many ways in which you can drive traffic to your website. Black Friday can be extremely beneficial to a business but not without a great product or excellent services. If you can invest in anything, ensure what you are offering is the best it can be at that time and ultimately that will lead you to finding your customers and getting a loyal customer base.&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;Black Friday tips and tricks that will ACTUALLY make you stand out in a sea of noise&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;black-friday-tips-and-tricks-that-will-actually-make-you-stand-out-in-a-sea-of-noise&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:38&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:01:38&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3918&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/black-friday-blog-780x520-1-780x520.webp&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:26,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:26,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:24,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:26,&quot;category_count&quot;:24,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We feel like the world of marketing has completely changed over the last couple of years! The pandemic naturally shifted the world a lot more digital, but people\u2019s concerns and values have really changed now and marketers have to adapt their strategy to perform.\n\nAs one of the top marketing agencies in London, we are under constant pressure to get results for our clients and stay on top of trends.\n\nWe\u2019ve been doing some digging into what\u2019s been getting the best results for clients and put together this guide of our top 10 marketing trends that we think we will see lots more of in 2023.\n\nThey\u2019re in no particular order\u2026\n\n&lt;u&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWe felt we had to start with this one! With so much talk at the moment about Chat GPT, we thought we\u2019d dig right into this subject immediately.\n\nFirst of all, we can assure you that this article is not written by AI :)\n\nWhilst we find it fascinating, we do not agree with content that\u2019s written by machines, as they don\u2019t &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;\/em&gt; understand our audience yet. Plus, it doesn\u2019t really go with our \u201cNo BS\u201d tagline!\n\nBut machines are getting smarter and smarter, and the quality of content they\u2019re spitting out is scarily good.\n\nOur director, Sabrina Chevannes, even suggested that &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H1009.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22>Chat GPT could possibly replace some employees!&lt;\/a&gt; We haven\u2019t done that yet, but it is a scary suggestion.\n\nWhile we think that AI tools aren\u2019t good enough to create full copy, they are brilliant at generating ideas!

So, many brands just can\u2019t afford to get involved.\n\nFor example, the Metaverse is something that has been spoken about a great deal over the last couple of years, but we haven\u2019t really seen the need to get our clients to invest in it as there just isn\u2019t the audience there.\n\nBut &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/ikea-space-unfolded-pop-up-provides-shoppers-with-ar-powered-design-experience/_brands.html like IKEA&lt;\/a&gt; have shown that using AR\/VR to create immersive experiences for their customers can be hugely beneficial.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.adroll.com/blog/augmented-and-virtual-reality-in-marketing/_cost-effective.html ways of integrating AR\/VR into your marketing campaigns&lt;\/a&gt;, and we expect to see a lot more of these in 2023.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Storytelling&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nStorytelling has been a staple of marketing since the dawn of time, so it's no surprise that this trend is still going strong. But what does storytelling mean in the context of 2023? In many ways, it's about taking a step back from traditional approaches and breaking out with new ideas to engage customers.\n\nStorytelling doesn't have to involve fiction\u2014it can also be used as an effective way to communicate product benefits or ideas in your company culture. While we're all familiar with fictional stories such as books or movies, storytelling isn't inherently limited to those mediums; you can use the same techniques in your social media content or blog posts for example.\n\nAs long as you're telling stories that resonate with your audience, they'll be more likely to pay attention than if you just spew out facts without context or meaning behind them (not that there's anything wrong with facts). This can even help customers who aren't usually interested in learning more about your company learn something new by connecting them emotionally through their personal experiences rather than just spouting off stats and figures.\n\nThink about the rise in personal branding at the moment \u2013 you will see plenty of people \u201cteaching\u201d storytelling now so that individuals can build up a personal brand and really connect with their audience.\n\nBrands can also do this, and connect with their audience on a more emotional level.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Privacy&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAs consumers become more aware of the value of their personal data, it's likely that data privacy will continue to be a key concern for businesses in the coming years.\n\nThis means that businesses will need to be transparent about how they collect, use, and protect customer data, and will need to ensure that they are in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. By prioritising data privacy, businesses can build trust with their customers and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/future-of-marketing/privacy-and-trust/research-customer-expectations-ads-privacy/_Google.html even did some research&lt;\/a&gt; into how their ads performed and those brands who respected data performed much better with their ads.\n\nSo, these are our predictions for marketing trends in 2023, but the world of marketing is so unpredictable at times, so let\u2019s see how many we get right!\n\nWe will see you back here in a year where we review them :)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Black Friday tips and tricks that will ACTUALLY make you stand out in a sea of noise&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;Is your business Black Friday ready?

There are hundreds of digital marketing agencies in London, all appearing to offer the same service. However, upon closer inspection, you can see there is a clear difference between the agencies.\n\nAt Rankh Hive, our focus is on providing the best value to our clients and ensuring each of clients see tangible results in their digital marketing. So, whether we're doing social media marketing, SEO, email marketing campaigns or providing PR services, our clients can really &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;\/em&gt; the impact that our digital marketing services are having on their company.\n&lt;h2&gt;Recognised as a Top Digital Marketing Agency in London&lt;\/h2&gt;\nSince we\u2019re so dedicated to providing a top quality service, we\u2019re so proud to be recognised as one of the &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.designrush.com/agency/digital-marketing/uk/london/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;top 10 digital marketing agencies in London by Design Rush&lt;\/a&gt;.\n\nWhilst we do not do this for the recognition, it\u2019s always an honour when an external company appreciates the work that we do.\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img class=\&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5414 size-full\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/design-rush-top-digital-marketing.png/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;151\&quot; height=\&quot;218\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What does it take to be a Top Digital Marketing Agency in London?&lt;\/h2&gt;\nAs a full-service creative agency, we are more than just a digital marketing agency, since we also offer branding and website design and development services.

The pandemic naturally shifted the world a lot more digital, but people\u2019s concerns and values have really changed now and marketers have to adapt their strategy to perform.\n\nAs one of the top marketing agencies in London, we are under constant pressure to get results for our clients and stay on top of trends.\n\nWe\u2019ve been doing some digging into what\u2019s been getting the best results for clients and put together this guide of our top 10 marketing trends that we think we will see lots more of in 2023.\n\nThey\u2019re in no particular order\u2026\n\n&lt;u&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWe felt we had to start with this one! With so much talk at the moment about Chat GPT, we thought we\u2019d dig right into this subject immediately.\n\nFirst of all, we can assure you that this article is not written by AI :)\n\nWhilst we find it fascinating, we do not agree with content that\u2019s written by machines, as they don\u2019t &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;\/em&gt; understand our audience yet. Plus, it doesn\u2019t really go with our \u201cNo BS\u201d tagline!\n\nBut machines are getting smarter and smarter, and the quality of content they\u2019re spitting out is scarily good.\n\nOur director, Sabrina Chevannes, even suggested that &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H1009.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22>Chat GPT could possibly replace some employees!&lt;\/a&gt; We haven\u2019t done that yet, but it is a scary suggestion.\n\nWhile we think that AI tools aren\u2019t good enough to create full copy, they are brilliant at generating ideas! So, if you\u2019re trying to come up with a content plan, then why not ask it for some blog post suggestions? How about some keyword research for your website so you know what to target.\n\nAI can do all of these things, as well as even write you a whole month of social media content in 2 mins! You may want to tweak some of these and put them in your own tone of voice, but wow\u2026 AI is really going to be a game-changer for marketers.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H/indexe842.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22 target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone wp-image-5528 size-full\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;522\&quot; height=\&quot;653\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;User-generated content and influencers&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nInfluencer marketing isn\u2019t a new marketing trend, but it is one that\u2019s still going strong. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2022/08/23/the-creator-economy-is-booming-heres-how-businesses-can-tap-into-its-potential/index23cc.html?sh=127d5e933d27\%22>The creator economy is booming&lt;\/a&gt; and more and more people want to become a content creator and embrace their entrepreneurial side.\n\nPeople care more about \u201creal\u201d footage and brands who are not lying to their customers. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.frontify.com/en/blog/the-age-of-authenticity-why-brands-need-to-get-real/_90%25.html of consumers say they would rather buy from authentic brands&lt;\/a&gt; and so picking the right influencer is also hugely important.\n\nBrands are shying away from using big celebrity endorsements as consumers are aware of the paid affiliation and paying less attention to these ads. This is why we think that &lt;strong&gt;nano-influencers&lt;\/strong&gt; are likely to be more popular in 2023.\n\nNano-influencers are accounts with 5-10k followers, but they have a much more loyal following, who believe what they have to say and are more likely to be authentic. &lt;a href=../../_https_/yougov.co.uk/topics/resources/articles-reports/2022/03/18/62-social-media-users-trust-influencers-more-celeb/_62%25.html of social media users said they trust influencers over celebrities.&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Responsibility&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nJust how consumers care more about authenticity now, they also care about social responsibility.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/consumer-trends/harris-poll-82-of-consumers-want-a-brands-values-to-align-with-their-own/_recent.html Harris Poll&lt;\/a&gt; showed that 82% of customers will pick brands that align with their values, which means that brands also need to be showing more of who they are and what they believe in online.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/bcorporation.uk/reinventing-business/by-b-lab-uk/celebrating-5-000-b-corps/_now.html over 5000 B Corps&lt;\/a&gt; and still a long waiting list, which shows that companies are trying to do more than just make a profit.\n\nCompanies who show they are genuinely interested in sustainability, DEI and giving back, will more likely do well in 2023. But the key word here is &lt;strong&gt;genuinely&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 if you get caught faking it, it\u2019s worse than doing nothing about it.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Hyper-personalisation&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThe world has moved on from Hey [first-name] in emails!

By prioritising data privacy, businesses can build trust with their customers and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/future-of-marketing/privacy-and-trust/research-customer-expectations-ads-privacy/_Google.html even did some research&lt;\/a&gt; into how their ads performed and those brands who respected data performed much better with their ads.\n\nSo, these are our predictions for marketing trends in 2023, but the world of marketing is so unpredictable at times, so let\u2019s see how many we get right!\n\nWe will see you back here in a year where we review them :)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rankh Hive is a Top Digital Marketing Agency in London!&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;As a digital marketing agency in London, it can be quite difficult to stand out from the crowd. There are hundreds of digital marketing agencies in London, all appearing to [&amp;hellip;]&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/complex-creative-is-a-top-digital-marketing-agency-in-london\/&quot;},{&quot;ID&quot;:3653,&quot;post_author&quot;:&quot;7&quot;,&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;23rd August 2022&quot;,&quot;post_date_gmt&quot;:&quot;2022-08-23 08:00:04&quot;,&quot;post_content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=../../_https_/developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Google has just announced a new update&lt;\/a&gt; will be rolled out very soon and it\u2019s going to change the world of content. This update will favour content that is written for people rather than for search engines. You may think this has always been the case, with Google penalising &lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/what-is-black-hat-seo/_black.html hat SEO techniques&lt;\/a&gt;, so how is this update different?\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What is in Google\u2019s Helpful Content Update?&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/seo-graphic-2.svg/_img.html class=\&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3658\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/seo-graphic-2.svg/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a quote directly from Google:\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;\u201cThe helpful content update aims to better reward content where visitors feel they've had a satisfying experience, while content that doesn't meet a visitor's expectations won't perform as well.\u201d&lt;\/em&gt;\r\n\r\nThe Helpful Content Update contains a new site-wide signal which identifies content that is deemed as having little value, or of low value to searches. Therefore, any content on your website that has lots of \u201cunhelpful content\u201d will not do very well in Search because Google will consider more helpful sources better to display in their results.\r\n\r\nGoogle starts rolling out the update &lt;strong&gt;this week&lt;\/strong&gt; and will probably take a couple of weeks to be fully complete. You can keep track of the progress on &lt;a href=../../_https_/developers.google.com/search/updates/ranking/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;their updates page.&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nThis new process is also fully automated, using machine-learning, so it\u2019s yet another factor in Google\u2019s mysterious algorithm that we have to navigate through.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for website content?&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\nGoogle has recommended that you \u201cremove unhelpful content\u201d from your website. But what does this exactly mean?\r\n\r\nOur advice would be that you should do an audit of your website content and think: \u201cIs my content directed at humans, or am I trying to attract search engines to boost my SEO?\u201d\r\n\r\nHere are some questions you can ask yourself. If you answer yes to any of these questions, then it may be sensible to redo some of that content:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Have you produced lots of content specifically with the goal of ranking in search engines?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Are you using AI tools to produce content?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Are you summarising trending topics without adding any extra value?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Would your readers come to your site and still feel they need to continue searching after reading your content?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt;Have you created any clickbait titles that tempted the reader to click into your content and then you didn\u2019t answer their question?&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;How can I write good content to rank well after Google\u2019s new Helpful Content Update?&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/developers.google.com/search/blog/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Google\u2019s advice&lt;\/a&gt; has always remained the same \u2013 write for &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;\/strong&gt; not for search engines. They\u2019ve also produced &lt;a href=../../_https_/developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/webmaster-guidelines/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;guidelines for webmasters&lt;\/a&gt; and how to approach things from a technical perspective too.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/audit-graphic.svg/_img.html class=\&quot;wp-image-3656 alignleft\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/audit-graphic.svg/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;363\&quot; height=\&quot;326\&quot; \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;The narrative has always been the same \u2013 think about your reader and write what they want to hear. Don\u2019t lie to them, don\u2019t try to manipulate them, don\u2019t play tricks to try and rank better \u2013 just write good quality content.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Avoid AI copy software!!!&lt;\/strong&gt; The likes of &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.copy.ai/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Copy AI&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.copy.ai/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Jasper&lt;\/a&gt; have been talked about a lot in the world of content marketing and many companies have been loving that they can have AI write them a blog post in seconds. It\u2019s very cool, don\u2019t get me wrong, but the content that it spews out isn\u2019t great quality.\r\n\r\nThink about it too\u2026 if everyone in your niche puts the same trending topics into these bits of software, won\u2019t all your competitors end up with the same blog? That can\u2019t be good for anyone! Even though the AI in Copy AI and Jasper do write in a more friendly and \u201chuman\u201d way than we\u2019ve seen in other similar copywriting AI tools, the content isn\u2019t good quality and it certainly doesn\u2019t answer readers\u2019 questions.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re worried because you\u2019re not a great writer, then don\u2019t worry, as not every reader will be one either. Use tools like &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.copy.ai/index.html target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Grammarly&lt;\/a&gt;, which can help you check your grammar and write better. At the end of the day, if it answers the searcher\u2019s question, it\u2019s probably a good article!&quot;,&quot;post_title&quot;:&quot;Google's New \&quot;Helpful Content\&quot; Update: What does it mean for content?&quot;,&quot;post_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_status&quot;:&quot;publish&quot;,&quot;comment_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;ping_status&quot;:&quot;open&quot;,&quot;post_password&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_name&quot;:&quot;googles-new-helpful-content-update&quot;,&quot;to_ping&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pinged&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_modified&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:02:05&quot;,&quot;post_modified_gmt&quot;:&quot;2023-02-14 11:02:05&quot;,&quot;post_content_filtered&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;post_parent&quot;:0,&quot;guid&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/?p=3653&quot;,&quot;menu_order&quot;:0,&quot;post_type&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;post_mime_type&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;comment_count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Google-Helpful.jpeg&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:[{&quot;term_id&quot;:24,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:24,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:62,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:24,&quot;category_count&quot;:62,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;All&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;all&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:26,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:26,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:24,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:26,&quot;category_count&quot;:24,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;Marketing&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;marketing&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:25,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:25,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:12,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:25,&quot;category_count&quot;:12,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0},{&quot;term_id&quot;:30,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;SEO&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;seo&quot;,&quot;term_group&quot;:0,&quot;term_taxonomy_id&quot;:30,&quot;taxonomy&quot;:&quot;category&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;:0,&quot;count&quot;:7,&quot;filter&quot;:&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;cat_ID&quot;:30,&quot;category_count&quot;:7,&quot;category_description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cat_name&quot;:&quot;SEO&quot;,&quot;category_nicename&quot;:&quot;seo&quot;,&quot;category_parent&quot;:0}],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We feel like the world of marketing has completely changed over the last couple of years! The pandemic naturally shifted the world a lot more digital, but people\u2019s concerns and values have really changed now and marketers have to adapt their strategy to perform.\n\nAs one of the top marketing agencies in London, we are under constant pressure to get results for our clients and stay on top of trends.\n\nWe\u2019ve been doing some digging into what\u2019s been getting the best results for clients and put together this guide of our top 10 marketing trends that we think we will see lots more of in 2023.\n\nThey\u2019re in no particular order\u2026\n\n&lt;u&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWe felt we had to start with this one! With so much talk at the moment about Chat GPT, we thought we\u2019d dig right into this subject immediately.\n\nFirst of all, we can assure you that this article is not written by AI :)\n\nWhilst we find it fascinating, we do not agree with content that\u2019s written by machines, as they don\u2019t &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;\/em&gt; understand our audience yet. Plus, it doesn\u2019t really go with our \u201cNo BS\u201d tagline!\n\nBut machines are getting smarter and smarter, and the quality of content they\u2019re spitting out is scarily good.\n\nOur director, Sabrina Chevannes, even suggested that &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H1009.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22>Chat GPT could possibly replace some employees!&lt;\/a&gt; We haven\u2019t done that yet, but it is a scary suggestion.\n\nWhile we think that AI tools aren\u2019t good enough to create full copy, they are brilliant at generating ideas! So, if you\u2019re trying to come up with a content plan, then why not ask it for some blog post suggestions? How about some keyword research for your website so you know what to target.\n\nAI can do all of these things, as well as even write you a whole month of social media content in 2 mins! You may want to tweak some of these and put them in your own tone of voice, but wow\u2026 AI is really going to be a game-changer for marketers.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.linkedin.com/posts/sabrinachevannes_how-chat-gpt-can-replace-your-employees-activity-7018138984664948736-e31H/indexe842.html?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\%22 target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone wp-image-5528 size-full\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-1.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;522\&quot; height=\&quot;653\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;User-generated content and influencers&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nInfluencer marketing isn\u2019t a new marketing trend, but it is one that\u2019s still going strong. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2022/08/23/the-creator-economy-is-booming-heres-how-businesses-can-tap-into-its-potential/index23cc.html?sh=127d5e933d27\%22>The creator economy is booming&lt;\/a&gt; and more and more people want to become a content creator and embrace their entrepreneurial side.\n\nPeople care more about \u201creal\u201d footage and brands who are not lying to their customers. &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.frontify.com/en/blog/the-age-of-authenticity-why-brands-need-to-get-real/_90%25.html of consumers say they would rather buy from authentic brands&lt;\/a&gt; and so picking the right influencer is also hugely important.\n\nBrands are shying away from using big celebrity endorsements as consumers are aware of the paid affiliation and paying less attention to these ads. This is why we think that &lt;strong&gt;nano-influencers&lt;\/strong&gt; are likely to be more popular in 2023.\n\nNano-influencers are accounts with 5-10k followers, but they have a much more loyal following, who believe what they have to say and are more likely to be authentic. &lt;a href=../../_https_/yougov.co.uk/topics/resources/articles-reports/2022/03/18/62-social-media-users-trust-influencers-more-celeb/_62%25.html of social media users said they trust influencers over celebrities.&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Responsibility&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nJust how consumers care more about authenticity now, they also care about social responsibility.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/consumer-trends/harris-poll-82-of-consumers-want-a-brands-values-to-align-with-their-own/_recent.html Harris Poll&lt;\/a&gt; showed that 82% of customers will pick brands that align with their values, which means that brands also need to be showing more of who they are and what they believe in online.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/bcorporation.uk/reinventing-business/by-b-lab-uk/celebrating-5-000-b-corps/_now.html over 5000 B Corps&lt;\/a&gt; and still a long waiting list, which shows that companies are trying to do more than just make a profit.\n\nCompanies who show they are genuinely interested in sustainability, DEI and giving back, will more likely do well in 2023. But the key word here is &lt;strong&gt;genuinely&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 if you get caught faking it, it\u2019s worse than doing nothing about it.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Hyper-personalisation&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nThe world has moved on from Hey [first-name] in emails! There\u2019s so much more now when it comes to personalisation.\n\nYou\u2019re probably already freaked out that you could be talking about something one moment and then the next, you see if on your Facebook\/Instagram feed.Yup \u2013 everyone is listening\u2026 in one way or another.\n\nMarketing is going to get hyper-personalised, thanks to the use of AI and there are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thedrum.com/opinion/2022/09/22/hyper-personalization-here-how-can-brands-use-it-boost-retail-results/_so.html many ways that brands can use it to their advantage&lt;\/a&gt;.\n\nA &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail/_recent.html report from McKinsey&lt;\/a&gt; stated that consumers are 80% more likely to buy from brands if their shopping experience is personalised.\n\nThis makes complete sense as we are always talking about making sure you\u2019re talking &lt;strong&gt;directly to your customer&lt;\/strong&gt;.\n\nNow, with the use of all this modern tech, there are ways you can do just that, and tailor their experience to their personal likes, wants and needs.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Social Commerce&lt;\/u&gt;\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5529\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-Image-2-800x534.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;534\&quot;&gt;\n\nAgain, social commerce is not a new trend, but it is rising again! As the world has gotten so used to shopping online, most brands now have a decent digital presence.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/_Social.html media use is still increasing&lt;\/a&gt; too, so brands are looking for how to increase the user experience (UX), by allowing their customers to check out directly from their social media posts.\n\nThis goes perfectly in hand with the UGC element we mentioned, as then influencers can directly tag products and make for a seamless shopping experience.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Virtual Events&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nWhile the world has come back to a more normal feel after the pandemic, people\u2019s priorities have shifted. Many value spending quality time at home a lot more and are not attending events as frequently.\n\nIn-person events are definitely an amazing experience for many, but they also require a huge budget, a lot of resources and can be very stressful to run.\n\nYou can reach an international audience a lot more quickly and cheaper when running virtual events.\n\nNow that COVID made the likes of Zoom and webinars feel a bit more \u201cnormal\u201d, it\u2019s a great time to embrace all your options to expand your reach and network by running more virtual events and streaming live.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Use of Video&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nIt feels like we put this in our trends every year, but it just keeps on increasing in popularity!\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why we\u2019ve seen a huge popularity in TikTok and YouTube over the last couple of years.\n\nBut every social media channel has really started to &lt;a href=../../_https_/guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent603f.html?sessionId=3_cc-session_04f6ffd4-00fb-4279-a2dc-c2ee00d8d8f6&amp;amp;lang=en-US\%22>shift towards promoting video&lt;\/a&gt; and so there\u2019s even more pressure to produce good video content.\n\nThis has caused some of our clients a bit of anxiety as they don\u2019t feel they have the budget to produce quality videos, but luckily consumers like the \u201craw\u201d video feel where you get to genuinely see what a brand is like.\n\nThis can be done easily on a smartphone and minimal video editing is required. Plus, with the native features within TikTok and Reels, there\u2019s so much potential.\n\n&lt;img class=\&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-5527\&quot; src=../../_https_/wearecomplexcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/graph-800x506.webp/index.html alt=\&quot;\&quot; width=\&quot;800\&quot; height=\&quot;506\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: center;\&quot;&gt;Caption: Source = Statista. January 2022&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;u&gt;AR\/VR&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAugmented reality and virtual reality have been spoken about a lot over the last few years and big things have been predicted from them, but not too much has come to light.\n\nThis is probably because the technology is so complicated and is largely quite expensive to implement. So, many brands just can\u2019t afford to get involved.\n\nFor example, the Metaverse is something that has been spoken about a great deal over the last couple of years, but we haven\u2019t really seen the need to get our clients to invest in it as there just isn\u2019t the audience there.\n\nBut &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-store-design/ikea-space-unfolded-pop-up-provides-shoppers-with-ar-powered-design-experience/_brands.html like IKEA&lt;\/a&gt; have shown that using AR\/VR to create immersive experiences for their customers can be hugely beneficial.\n\nThere are &lt;a href=../../_https_/www.adroll.com/blog/augmented-and-virtual-reality-in-marketing/_cost-effective.html ways of integrating AR\/VR into your marketing campaigns&lt;\/a&gt;, and we expect to see a lot more of these in 2023.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Storytelling&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nStorytelling has been a staple of marketing since the dawn of time, so it's no surprise that this trend is still going strong. But what does storytelling mean in the context of 2023? In many ways, it's about taking a step back from traditional approaches and breaking out with new ideas to engage customers.\n\nStorytelling doesn't have to involve fiction\u2014it can also be used as an effective way to communicate product benefits or ideas in your company culture. While we're all familiar with fictional stories such as books or movies, storytelling isn't inherently limited to those mediums; you can use the same techniques in your social media content or blog posts for example.\n\nAs long as you're telling stories that resonate with your audience, they'll be more likely to pay attention than if you just spew out facts without context or meaning behind them (not that there's anything wrong with facts). This can even help customers who aren't usually interested in learning more about your company learn something new by connecting them emotionally through their personal experiences rather than just spouting off stats and figures.\n\nThink about the rise in personal branding at the moment \u2013 you will see plenty of people \u201cteaching\u201d storytelling now so that individuals can build up a personal brand and really connect with their audience.\n\nBrands can also do this, and connect with their audience on a more emotional level.\n\n&lt;u&gt;Privacy&lt;\/u&gt;\n\nAs consumers become more aware of the value of their personal data, it's likely that data privacy will continue to be a key concern for businesses in the coming years.\n\nThis means that businesses will need to be transparent about how they collect, use, and protect customer data, and will need to ensure that they are in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. By prioritising data privacy, businesses can build trust with their customers and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.\n\n&lt;a href=../../_https_/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/future-of-marketing/privacy-and-trust/research-customer-expectations-ads-privacy/_Google.html even did some research&lt;\/a&gt; into how their ads performed and those brands who respected data performed much better with their ads.\n\nSo, these are our predictions for marketing trends in 2023, but the world of marketing is so unpredictable at times, so let\u2019s see how many we get right!\n\nWe will see you back here in a year where we review them :)&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Google&amp;#8217;s New &amp;#8220;Helpful Content&amp;#8221; Update: What does it mean for content?&quot;,&quot;excerpt&quot;:&quot;Google has just announced a new update will be rolled out very soon and it\u2019s going to change the world of content.
