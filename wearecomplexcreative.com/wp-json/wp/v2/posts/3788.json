They come to us because they have been working with other agencies who says there\u2019s nothing they can do about it because \u201cWordPress is just slow\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This is NONSENSE!<\/p>\n<p>Please feel free to run our own website through speed tests\u2026 yes, this website is a WordPress website! Doesn\u2019t look like it, right?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because we specialise in creating bespoke websites that <em>perform<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the main reasons why WordPress websites are really slow is because they\u2019re built badly in the first place. There\u2019s a lot of techy ways you can speed up a WordPress site, but we thought we\u2019d pick some that are easy enough to do yourself.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, having a custom WordPress website is always going to be a lot quicker and <a href=\"https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/what-is-sustainable-web-design\/\">better for the environment,<\/a> but we understand that a decent budget is required to do this and many do not have the option to do so.<\/p>\n<p>So, here are our top 5 ways to speed up your WordPress website that\u2019s simple to do without a web developer helping you.<\/p>\n<h2>Pick a good hosting company<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3789\" src=\"https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash.webp 1920w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-780x520.webp 780w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-520x347.webp 520w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-90x60.webp 90w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-800x534.webp 800w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-440x294.webp 440w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-400x267.webp 400w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/thisisengineering-raeng-zBLtU0zbJcU-unsplash-240x160.webp 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s really tempting to just Google \u201cwebsite hosting for WordPress\u201d and then just pick the cheapest option on there, but unfortunately, this could be the downfall to your website performance.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of the cheap website hosting packages don\u2019t offer many resources and you\u2019re sharing the server with thousands of other websites.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want your website to be fast, you can see if there\u2019s room in your budget for a dedicated server, so it\u2019s just your website using that.<\/p>\n<p>We personally use green website hosting as it uses completely renewable energy to power the server.<\/p>\n<p>One of our favourites is <a href=\"https:\/\/affiliate.k.io\/go\/YQr4uq8ezF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Krystal Hosting<\/a>, and they have some excellent WordPress specialist packages.<\/p>\n<h2>Optimise your images<\/h2>\n<p>Images can be the key to creating a beautiful website, and professional imagery can be very large! Therefore, if you upload images directly to your website in the format you got from your photographer, or perhaps downloaded from a stock website, then you will end up with a very slow website.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend sizing down your images to the size you need for your website and then running them through a compression service like <a href=\"http:\/\/tinypng.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TinyPNG<\/a>, which allows for lossless compression \u2013 meaning it won\u2019t lose the quality of the image.<\/p>\n<h2>Reduce the number of plugins<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3790\" src=\"https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins.webp 1920w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-780x520.webp 780w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-520x347.webp 520w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-90x60.webp 90w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-800x534.webp 800w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-440x294.webp 440w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-400x267.webp 400w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/wordpress-plugins-240x160.webp 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another main culprit of a slow WordPress website is having too many plugins! When you first start using WordPress, it can be quite addictive to keep adding plugins. After all, they add so much cool functionality to your website, and you don\u2019t even need to know how to code to do it!<\/p>\n<p>But each one of these plugins have so many files and really bulk down the site. They also come with a whole host of security issues too.<\/p>\n<p>Often, websites will end up crashing, because two plugins don\u2019t work well together and it\u2019s a nightmare to fix.<\/p>\n<p>So, only add plugins if you really have to! We\u2019ve managed to get WordPress sites from less than 10\/100 on <a href=\"https:\/\/pagespeed.web.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Page Speeds<\/a> to in the 80s purely from removing plugins!<\/p>\n<h2>Add caching to your website<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re starting to panic now because things are sounding more technical, please don\u2019t. This is still something you can do on your own!<\/p>\n<p>First up, caching is essentially your website saving the files of your site locally so it doesn\u2019t have to call upon the server to display your website. This way, when someone visits your website, the browser will show the cached version of your website, meaning it\u2019s so much quicker to load.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know we said not to use too many plugins, but a caching plugin should be helping you speed up your website, so it\u2019s allowed :-).<\/p>\n<p>HubSpot have written a great article on <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/website\/best-wordpress-cache-plugins-to-speed-up-a-site\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top caching plugins<\/a>, so you can take a look at their comparisons. W3 Total Cache is one of the most popular because it\u2019s completely FREE! It\u2019s been around a long time, and so you can trust its performance.<\/p>\n<h2>Use a CDN<\/h2>\n<p>Again, this one isn\u2019t too techy\u2026 we promise! A CDN stands for Content Delivery Network and what it does is hold a copy of your website\u2019s files in various data centres around the world. Therefore, whenever someone visits your website, it delivers the content from the closest data centre, making it much quicker for the visitor to receive the content.<\/p>\n<p>Again, you can add one to your website without the need of a developer, but we can also completely understand why you may want one for this stage.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/en-gb\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CloudFlare<\/a> if you\u2019re just starting out \u2013 it\u2019s free and the team there are really helpful and can help you set it up on your site.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the biggest complaints we get from new clients is that their WordPress website is too slow.
