Naturally, many people are going to pick whatever option they can that makes them have the most impressive looking website for within their budget, so this perhaps includes the use of pre-made templates and lots of video.<\/p>\n<p>This is probably the worst combination imaginable. Pre-made templates are pre-filled with so much excess code, high-res stock images and a lot of plugins to create fancy functionality.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a web developer\u2019s duty, therefore, to improve on this where they can. The ideal solution is to build something from scratch, therefore only inputting exactly what is required. This does not mean that you cannot use a CMS. WordPress is our weapon of choice and we just ensure we build bespoke WordPress sites that are fast and designed to perform. If you\u2019d like to know how to speed up your WordPress website, we have a guide for that too.<\/p>\n<p>The following tips will see some overlap with the tips seen in our WordPress Optimisation Guide because that\u2019s a major part of sustainable website design.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use Green Hosting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No matter how large your website, you can already help by hosting your website with a <a href=\"https:\/\/affiliate.k.io\/go\/YQr4uq8ezF\">hosting company who uses renewable energy<\/a>. Our green website hosting company of choice is <a href=\"https:\/\/affiliate.k.io\/go\/YQr4uq8ezF\">Krystal,<\/a> who have also planted 1 million trees already and are the first company to have reached this mark in the <a href=\"https:\/\/milliontreepledge.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Million Tree Pledge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Optimise your images<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is one of tasks that actually has the most impact on your website\u2019s performance, and it\u2019s super easy to do, but many people don\u2019t bother.<\/p>\n<p>The use of images can really improve the aesthetics of your website, but high-res images are extremely large and can severely slow down a website. You should always size down the image to the size that\u2019s required for your website and then compress them further. We do this by hitting \u201csave for web\u201d in Photoshop, but you can also run them through an online compression tool such as <a href=\"http:\/\/tinypng.com\/\">TinyPNG<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The file size is also extremely important; jpgs and pngs are the most common file types, but a modern format is webp, which has lossless image compression and reduce your file sizes by 1\/3.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use web safe fonts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>This one will crease most graphic designers up because typography is a huge part of beautiful website design. But from a performance perspective, custom self-hosted fonts slow down your website. The way to get the fastest speed is to pick one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/website\/web-safe-html-css-fonts\">18 web safe fonts available<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This won\u2019t work for most people, as their brand guidelines will not allow it. So, if you do need to use custom fonts, then upload them in WOFF and WOFF2 formats.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Minify your code<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your website will be created using HTML, CSS and JS code that can all be minified. What this means is that sometimes parts of this code loads unnecessarily and so we can clean this up so that it reduces file size and improves the page speed.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of tools out there that allow you to do this and you can then upload the minified code to your website.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do not autoplay video<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Video uses up a great deal of energy and is probably not as impactful as you think on your website. So, first up\u2026 think whether you actually need it on your website. Perhaps check your analytics and see how many views it\u2019s getting and whether it provides actual value.<\/p>\n<p>If you do feel that you need video on your website, then make sure that video does not autoplay. The best thing to do is to place an image screenshot of that video and then host that video offsite, such as on YouTube or Vimeo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use lazy loading<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you have ever been on a website and noticed that content only shows up as you scroll down the page, this will be lazy loading. This works because the website only shows the resources that are above the fold, and then loads the rest only if the user requires it.<\/p>\n<h2><u>Other Resources<\/u><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3346\" src=\"https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1520\" height=\"1013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2.webp 1520w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2-780x520.webp 780w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2-520x347.webp 520w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2-90x60.webp 90w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2-800x533.webp 800w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2-440x293.webp 440w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2-400x267.webp 400w, https:\/\/wearecomplexcreative.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/practice-sustainability-2-240x160.webp 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember, these are just some of the sustainable website design tips you can do to get started, but there are so many more things you can learn.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019d highly recommend purchasing <a href=\"https:\/\/abookapart.com\/products\/sustainable-web-design\">Tom Greenwood\u2019s book on Sustainable Web Design<\/a> as a great guide to building sustainable websites.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/bima.co.uk\/councils\/sustainability\/\">BIMA has a fantastic Sustainability Council<\/a>, which has been producing some impressive work and they put together this great set of resources to help you build green websites.
