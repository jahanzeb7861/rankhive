Any deposit will be specified in Schedule 1. This must be paid before any work is started by RankHive.<\/p>\n<p>All deposits shall be completely non-refundable. RankHive shall retain any deposits that are paid in the event of termination.<\/p>\n<p>The charges and payments by the Client exclude VAT, which RankHive shall add to its invoices at the appropriate rate.<\/p>\n<p>The Client shall pay each invoice which is properly due and submitted to it, by RankHive within 14 days of receipt. When the invoice must be paid depends on what kind of contract is in place:<\/p>\n<p>For one-off project-based contracts, RankHive will usually request 50% of the deposit upfront which must be paid in advance of them starting any work. The remaining 50% must be paid upon completion of the project, but before delivery of the work.<\/p>\n<p>RankHive reserve the right to request more deposit, or the full project amount, or to split any projects into additional milestones at the outset of the project. This will be reported in Schedule 1.<\/p>\n<p>For ongoing \/ retainer-based contracts, the payment of the retainer will be taken on the same day each month, depicted by the date of the start of the contract. By signing up to a monthly retainer contract, the Client agrees that this Agreement shall last for a minimum term of three months before termination of this Agreement is allowed, by giving no less than 1 months\u2019 notice in writing.<\/p>\n<p>For hourly rate contracts, the Client will be invoiced for a minimum of 10 hours upfront as a deposit with the rest to be billed at the end of the month.<\/p>\n<p>RankHive allows a maximum of 20 hours to be given to the Clients on credit. Once this 20-hour limit has been reached, the Client will be billed for the credit, which must be paid before RankHive can continue with any other work. RankHive will use commercially reasonable endeavours to notify the Client in advance of the 20-hour credit limit being reached.<\/p>\n<p>For hosting &amp; maintenance contracts, the Agreement is for 12 months and the payment is required at the start of the Agreement. If the Client wishes to terminate this Agreement, this must be done by giving no less than 1 months\u2019 notice in writing.<\/p>\n<p>If a party fails to make any payment due to the other party under this Agreement, by the due date for payment, then, without limiting the other party\u2019s remedies under clause 17, the defaulting party shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 4% per annum above the Bank of England base rate. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis, from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The defaulting party shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.<\/p>\n<p>RankHive shall also charge an administration fee for additional work carried out if any payment under the Agreement is not paid on time. The applicable administration fee is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a350.00 for a letter before action.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a3150 if the matter is sent to a debt collection agency.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a3250 if RankHive have to submit the case as a small claim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In relation to payments disputed in good faith, interest under clause 6.6 is payable only after the dispute is resolved, on sums found or agreed to be due, from the due date until payment.<\/p>\n<p>If a payment is late by 5 days or more, RankHive reserves the right to stop all further work until the payment is made in full.<\/p>\n<p>Invoices covering payment in respect of materials purchased by, or services provided to RankHive, or for reimbursement of expenses, shall be payable by the Client only if accompanied by relevant receipts and prior written approval was obtained from the Client.<\/p>\n<p>The parties agree that RankHive may review and increase the charges, provided that such charges will not be increased more than 4 times in any 12-month period. RankHive will give the Client not less than 1 month notice of any increase. If such increase is not acceptable to the Client, it may terminate this Agreement by giving 1 month notice to RankHive.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on RankHive\u2019s workload and the scope of the suggested project, RankHive may also operate a fast-track or out-of-hours service to complete work on short deadlines. If RankHive have capacity to deal with this work on a fast-track or out-of-hours basis we will let you know the time estimate and likely additional cost of this service.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard premium for out-of-hours is 1.5x the usual rate.<\/li>\n<li>Standard premium for fast-track work is 2x the usual rate.<\/li>\n<li>RankHive reserves the right to charge a higher rate than specified above.
